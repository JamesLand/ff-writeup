<p>I’m baaaaaaaaaaack&#8230;</p>
<p>I’m gonna be bored all day in the airport today, so I figured I’d take some time and write the first write up of the 2018 fantasy football season! My head is a mishmash of preseason week one right now. At time of writing there’s still four teams yet to play, and one first round QB left to make his NFL debut. But I’d like to take the time to talk about the other four, and fill in Mr. Rosen when he plays later tonight (after I’ve departed from Albuquerque and arrived back in the good ol’ Dee Eff Dub). And then I’ll fill in some talk about league info, draft details, and tell you about YOUR chance to slot in your very own write up at some point this season.</p>
<p>With that being said, let’s talk QBs. I’ll go in order of preseason debut, so that means we’re going to start with the Heisman trophy winner. Er, the first one. Lamar Jackson.</p>
<p>Lamar Jackson has the advantage (or disadvantage?) of already playing two preseason games. I got to see a little bit of the Bears Ravens game on the way home from the TDP fun event last week, and I’ve seen the highlights from the game this week vs the Rams. Lamar Jackson gets a lot of Michael Vick comparisons, and I think that’s more what people want him to be rather than what he is right now. Of the four quarterbacks that I’ve seen so far, I actually think he needs the most work. Yes, that includes Josh Allen. LJ’s first instinct is to scramble a lot of the time, and  while that worked well at Louisville, NFL defenses aren’t going to let him get away with that most of the time. Maybe sometimes &#8211; he did have a nice rushing TD vs the Rams. But until the young QB proves that he can beat you deep, and do it consistently, the formula for defending Lamar Jackson becomes very simple. Clog up the running lanes and force him to try. I don’t think Lamar Jackson sees meaningful playing time until he cleans this up, with two experienced QBs in front of him.</p>
<p>Now, let’s move on to the Heisman trophy winner. Er, the second one. Baker Mayfield.</p>
<figure id="attachment_43" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-43 size-full" title="(Callaway made a nice catch too)" src="/ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/baker.gif" alt="" width="320" height="180" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">It&#8217;s only preseason, and Baker&#8217;s already throwing like he&#8217;s in a divisional playoff game.</figcaption></figure>
<p>You guys are going to think I’m a dirty fucking homer, and you’re right. But I think Baker had the best rookie debut out of the five, and justified his first overall pick status. Also, I’ve kinda changed my mind about his ability to start in the NFL right now &#8211; I think he could play, and win games with the Browns. He won’t, because Tyrod Taylor is there and looks good too, but he could. He looks experienced already &#8211; the pace of the preseason NFL Giants defense did not affect his ability to tear it up and score two excellent TDs. His stats from that game are ok, but also a bit misleading. He went 11 of 20 for 212 yards and 2 TDs, but that includes a few drops from Antonio Callaway early on, and some  pressured throwaway decisions that were the right decisions. That was one thing that worried me about Baker coming out of college &#8211; he seemed to hold onto the ball too long, and would get into some bad situations because of it. He seems to have corrected that from his game, which is a nice step forward. But the positives are awesome. Baker converted about three third and longs, one of which was a circus throw off his back foot to Callaway, making a toe tap catch on the sideline. Baker avoids pressure well and goes through his reads with confidence, which is something he did exceptionally well in his last season at OU, so I’m not surprised it’s continuing here. He’s also got top notch ball placement, which was on display when he threw that slant to Callaway for a 50 yard TD on blanket coverage. I could go on, but this paragraph is huge already and you guys are probably tired of reading this love fest. So let’s move on.</p>
<figure id="attachment_42" style="width: 320px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-42 size-full" title="WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" src="/ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/allen.gif" alt="" width="320" height="180" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all!</figcaption></figure>
<p>Josh Allen’s Bills debut was not aired on NFL network, so I had to watch highlights on YouTube. Josh Allen is such a crazy prospect that I don’t know what to think of him. He looks like a superhero who just figured out that he has super strength, and doesn’t quite know how to control it yet. Dude can throw the ball like 80 fucking yards in the air, and it doesn’t even look like he’s trying. The ball leaves his hand and flies like it was shot out of a cannon. It’s nuts. On the other hand, his accuracy is hit and miss. Sometimes he puts it right on the money, but sometimes he overthrows his receiver by five yards (after his receiver has already run like 60 yards holy shit). His footwork looks pretty crazy too. He’s so raw, which is why I was so confused when the Bills drafted him over Josh Rosen. The Bills are starting Nathan Peterman, who admittedly looked better than his 5 int half of football last season. However, between Josh Allen and Josh Rosen, I would have thought that Rosen would be the ideal choice, as he would be more prepared to start week one. The Bills confuse me. Anyways, not much has really changed with Allen since his pre-draft assessment. If he gets an NFL start this season, he’ll be fun to watch, for one reason or another.</p>
<p>And then there’s Sam Darnold. For me, I think Darnold was the second best QB, but didn’t really show much in the Jets preseason game. Darnold has a lot of traits which make him an attractive rookie QB. He has great poise in the pocket, and has above average accuracy among the rookie QBs. Here’s my problem with Darnold so far &#8211; check his stat line. Darnold completed 13 of 18 passes for 96 yards and one touchdown. That’s a 72% completion rate, which is excellent. However, he’s just at about 5.3 yards per attempt, which is low. For reference, that’s a lower number than the season stats for all of the 32 “qualified” (&gt;14 attempts per game played) QBs. Lowest is Joe Flacco with 5.72. Going back and watching the tape, about half of Darnold’s completed passes are swing passes out of the backfield. He had three completed passes over 10 yards. One was a pass to a wide open receiver. One was his touchdown pass, which was a great pass to the corner of the endzone. And one was a 3rd and 11 conversion, which was his best pass of the day, in my opinion. The rest was dink and dunk. I don’t know if it was a product of the Jets playcalling, or how the Falcons D was playing, or what, but I don’t feel like Darnold was asked to do anything really difficult yet. I would like to see more from the young QB before anointing him the starter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m adding these Josh Rosen comments on Sunday night, after watching his preseason debut yesterday. It&#8217;s hard for me to slot him in somewhere because he was getting no help at all from his supporting cast, specifically his offensive line. He only played for a quarter, and that whole time he was either running for his life or crouching down to pick up low snaps.</p>
<p>Now that my random football thought of the week is over and done with, let’s talk about the league itself. This year, the league has undergone a few changes from last year. We’re trying out a few different rules, after some debate and discussion at Pluckers a couple of weeks ago. I’m going to list the most notable changes below:</p>
<p>First off, we’re switching to 0.5 PPR this year, which was the least controversial of the changes. With this scoring system in effect, the value of pass catching rbs and receivers who catch a lot of passes for short yardage increase, so basically that means you should spend $100 on Jarvis Landry.</p>
<p>Secondly, we’re doing an auction draft this year, which should be kind of crazy but also pretty fun. Grab your Beer sheets and start figuring out your favorite players, because everybody can get anybody for the right price this year. Budget is $200.</p>
<p>Third, we’re adding keeper rules, which will mostly take effect next year. Start looking for that draft steal worth a first rounder that you can get for $5 and keep for $20. Only one keeper allowed, and you can only keep for one year.</p>
<p>And finally, free agency is different this year. We’ll be utilizing FAAB (that’s Free Agency Acquisition Budget, for the acronymically challenged) with a budget of $100. Bids currently resolve every day at 11 AM with the exception of Tuesday. Tiebreakers are by reverse order of standing, and I don&#8217;t think that’s something I can alter.</p>
<p>Next order of business is to introduce all of the teams and their GMs. In reverse order of last year’s standings, here are the teams.</p>
<p>Taking over Harrison’s spot in the league is Chris Young. Also known as the only guy who would talk fantasy football with us last year who wasn’t in our league. Chris will certainly be a force in the upcoming season. I’m excited to see what he can do in our league, although I’m not excited about having another UF alum to constantly bring up 2008 all the time (looking at you, Damian).</p>
<p>Replacing Warren will be Oron Hazi. I don’t know as much about the fantasy basketball league, but I do know that Oron played in it. We’re happy to have him with us in football this year &#8211; it will be a nice change of pace from listening to Warren talk about his algorithms and how he “read the case” all year. If Oron applies the same levels of determination to FF that he did to DnB then his team will be successful.</p>
<p>Returning teams:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike Fortman &#8211; After a dismal start, Mike bounced back to win a few, but could not overcome his initial struggles in order to contend for playoffs. Mike hopes to rebound this season.</li>
<li>Justin Katz &#8211; An early season 40 from Kareem Hunt looked promising for Justin, but his hopes fell flat down the stretch. Could this be the year that Justin climbs to the top of the ranks?</li>
<li>Ian Kwan &#8211; A late season surge, fueled by a large trade, almost propelled Ian to the playoffs. How will he fare this year?</li>
<li>James Land &#8211; I was ok. Maybe I’ll be better this year?</li>
<li>Anthony Cudznovic &#8211; Was hurt by the loss of his first round draft pick, David Johnson. Hopefully his luck will improve this year.</li>
<li>Jaiden Gerig &#8211; Fournette and Crew led to the playoff berth for this fantasy football newcomer. Can he repeat last year&#8217;s success?</li>
<li>Reece Boyd &#8211; Renowned trader and semifinals team looks to climb even higher this year. Can he do it?</li>
<li>Siddharth Sharma &#8211; Last year’s third place finisher, and regular season best record. Sidd returns again to try to win it all.</li>
<li>Damian Larson &#8211; With the hopes that he will quit asking for everyone’s best player, our runner up returns to contend once again for the championship.</li>
<li>Thomas Huerta &#8211; Last year’s champion, and current trophy holder. Thomas will seek to dominate once again and repeat as champ.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are the teams. We still need to figure out a draft date, but it seems the leading possibility is August 29th, starting at 6:00 pm (that&#8217;s a Wednesday, my dudes). Let me know what you guys think about that date and time.</p>
<p>Finally, I’m going to open up several spots this year for guest writers to contribute their write ups this year. By the end of the year last year I was experiencing write up fatigue, so what better way to relieve that fatigue than by pushing the job onto the rest of you! I’d like to fill five write up spots this year with volunteers. If you would like to sign up, let me know and I will give you a slot.</p>
