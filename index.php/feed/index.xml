Hope this writeup finds you in good spirits, surrounded by loved ones, or at least those people that you tolerate even though they may not share the same political opinions as you do simply because you are related to them. Try not to get into too many arguments. Anyways, I just wanted to bring you all an update on the playoff picture, talk superlatives for Week 11, and give out the weekly prize. Short and sweet this week, mostly because I did a big one last week and I kept forgetting about this one.</p>

<p>Notable movements:</p>
<p>Sidd’s team picked up a loss this week against Jaiden, which is not what I had predicted in last week’s writeup. Unfortunately for Sidd, Todd Gurley had his worst game of the year (only 10 points) and the Rams D performed better than expected against the Chiefs, so Jaiden got the W. As a result, Sidd falls to 3<sup>rd</sup>, moving him out of the first round BYE spot. Ian and I currently hold those spots. Sidd needs to try to pick up a win in the next two weeks to ensure a playoff spot. He has not clinched one as of now, and there is a scenario or two in which he gets left out. Sidd would have to lose both games, and both Reece and Mike would have to win out for this to happen. If Sidd wins one of the games, he would almost certainly beat both 8-5 Reece and Mike on tiebreaks.</p>
<p>Mike’s team lost to Ian, and at the same time Reece beat Thomas. Both of these teams now have the same record, but Reece has the edge on points, so he moves ahead of Mike in the standings. Mike is currently looking like the odd team out in the majority of the playoff scenarios. Even if he does make 8-5, he has to hope for one of the other top seven teams to be 7-6 in order to get in, because of his low point total.</p>
<p>Anthony did not pick up a win this week, and falls to 5 and 6. His playoff hopes are basically done – he would have to win out, and hope for Reece and Mike to lose out.</p>
<p>Everyone else is still trying to make playoffs. Ian and myself have basically clinched at this point, and are competing for first round BYEs. Jaiden and Chris got big wins and moved up, and are also now in contention for a first round BYE. One of Ian and myself will have to lose this week, and Jaiden has a chance to beat Ian – if Jaiden wins out and Ian and I drop a game each, it would come down to tiebreaks. Jaiden would  have to win big in his last few matchups to move up in PF. Chris’s team doesn’t have any effect since he doesn’t play me, Ian, or Jaiden in the last few matchups, but he could still win out and be in contention for first round BYE.</p>
<p>So right now, it looks like it’s gonna be Ian and me as the most likely first round BYE contenders (although one of us will lose this week), with Sidd, Jaiden, and Chris likely to make playoffs, and Reece the last man in. There are still two games to be played, however, so nothing is set in stone. Seeding is all over the place – who knows what may happen there.</p>
<p>Now, this.</p>
<p><strong>Best Team: </strong>It was really close at the top this week, but the best team goes to Reece by a nose! Lead by his waiver wire acquisition of Jared Goff (why did nobody else contest him?) Reece’s team had very little to worry about, and cruised right on through his matchup with Thomas. Strong performances from Ingram and McCaffrey, Beckham and Hopkins carried his team to victory. All of a sudden, Reece’s team is pretty scary looking. His only weak links this week were his tight end, Doyle (who knows who is getting targets in that two tight end offense) and his flex, Jeffery, who had a rough day at the office vs. the Saints (well mostly Wentz did).</p>
<p><strong>Highest-Scoring Loser: </strong>Mike would have beaten Justin, but not anybody else who won this week. Solid numbers at 119, and he did have the best overall player, but it just wasn’t enough.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest-Scoring Winner: </strong>Good thing Justin wasn’t playing Mike this week! Honestly, not a lot of injustice in terms of really high scoring matchups this week. Justin finally got a big game out of T.Y. Hilton, which is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel: </strong>I feel bad writing about Dame here again. I feel like I’ve written about him here many times, and it was funny the first time, but his team is just bad right now. Decent points out of Rivers, and a good day for AD, but that’s it. Nothing else noteworthy. At least he gets Chubb back next week.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player: </strong>Tyreek Hill was unstoppable on Monday night. Dude was abusing Sam Shields on every snap. Ten catches, 215 yards, and two touchdowns. One of those was a 70+ yarder where he was so wide open it wasn’t even funny. 38.5 is the highest I think a WR has scored yet this year. Talk about a big game.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start: </strong>This usually goes to whichever team started a negative defense, but nobody did this week. I thought I was going to ridicule Jaiden but the Rams D was actually great on Monday. So instead, I’ll ridicule my opponent, Oron, who started two receivers that didn’t play. I mean, it probably wouldn’t have mattered much, but you have to give yourself a chance to win.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench: </strong>Anthony forgot to start his defense, which was pretty dumb, but it would have only saved him one point. Big misses this week came with the Arizona receivers – both Fitz and Kirk put up 15 point games (although Jaiden and Ian won easily without them). Also, Josh Adams, somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge: </strong>This week’s challenge was the “Gotta catch ‘em all” challenge, going to the team who started the receiver that caught the most passes. And this week, that was Stefon Diggs with 13! And somehow, he ended up with 13 fewer points than Hill, who only caught 10… Anyways, that means that Thomas wins the challenge this week! Nice work, Thomas.</p>
<p>Happy Turkey Day – go eat and watch the Cowboys take the lead in the NFC East!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It feels like it has been ages since I did a writeup. I think the last one was back in week seven? No, that was Justin. Week six, I guess, because this week is week 10, last week was Oron, the week before was BYE, and week seven was Justin. So yeah, four weeks ago I did a writeup. Shit, I’m probably out of practice. What comes first? Bottom of the barrel? No, let’s actually do a blurb about goddamn football for once, because this isn’t a fantasy League of Legends league (how would that even work?).</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" src="https://streamable.com/s/rkurv/mtcfos" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think I’ll start by talking about some of the highlights of week ten, at least for me. In the noon slot, I had two games that I was keeping an eye on. First, and more briefly because I didn’t have the audio on for this one, was the Chiefs vs. the Cardinals. This game featured the Return of David Johnson, a player who has been overdue for a thirty point game, and finally got one, albeit in a loss to the Chiefs. Honestly, the Cards showed a decent amount of improvement on offense this week. The Chiefs aren’t the greatest defensive team in the league, so it doesn’t take too much to be successful against them, but the Cards were at least getting DJ the ball in the flat, which is all you need to do for him to be successful. The main thing that they still struggle with is protecting Josh Rosen long enough for him to do anything, which really hurts the passing game. Meanwhile, on the defensive side of the ball they let Tyreek Hill into the endzone a couple of times, but otherwise locked down pretty well inside the red zone. The Cardinals allowed 26 points, which is not good, but considering the types of scores the Chiefs usually put up, it’s promising. The Cardinals hope to get their third win of the season (the other two being against the 49ers) vs. the Raiders next Sunday.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" src="https://streamable.com/s/sxfo1/tzbxs" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<div></div>
<p>In the noon slot, I was more focused on my (new this season) AFC team, The cLeveLLLLLand broWWWns, who notched their first November win since 2014, which was coincidentally also against the Atlanta Falcons (as this one was). This game, in all phases, was probably the best Browns performance this season. The offense was clicking, in both the passing and running  games. Nick Chubb had his best fantasy week, with his career-long 92 yard rushing touchdown coming very early in his career, a run which he will probably never top (and the longest run in franchise history). Baker Mayfield posted fantastic numbers as well – 17 of 20, going 13/13 on his first 13 passes for 216 yards and 3 touchdowns, one of which was a nice improvised throw to Rashard Higgins on a broken play. His passer rating today of 151.3 was the highest of any of the rookie quarterbacks for a single game so far in 2018. He’s dangerous. Browns get a much-needed win to instill confidence in their team after the dismissal of their head coach and offensive coordinator, and will face the suddenly very beatable Cincinnati Bengals next week. The Falcons? They go back home to face the Dallas Cowboys, who have already beaten one bird team this month (more on that later).</p>
<p>I didn’t pay attention as much to the late afternoon slot games – was meeting my folks after their week-long trip to Ireland. I did, however, cross my fingers any time the Rams got near the endzone that Gurley wouldn’t get the TD, and swore up a storm when I heard about Gordon’s 60 yarder. As of the time of writing, I’m still alive in that game, assuming that Kittle stays around his season average. Come on, New York Football Giants.</p>
<p>In the evening, we had the spectacle of Dallas vs. Philadelphia in Philadelphia. During this last week, I was not very hopeful about this game. Dallas had just had a piss-poor showing vs the Titans on Monday Night Football, being unable to capitalize on two early turnovers and losing the game down the stretch. We were already facing a short week, but to add to that, Philly was coming off of a BYE week, and as a result had much more time to prepare for the matchup. Dallas would be out another starter on the offensive line, left guard Connor Williams, who had admittedly not been the superstar that we were expecting he would be, but was still first on the depth chart. Of course, Travis Frederick is still out and will likely remain out for the season. On the defensive side of the ball, we were missing David Irving and Taco Charlton on the line, and Sean Lee at linebacker. I didn’t know this at the time, because I’m a Cowboys homer and didn’t look at the Philly inactives, but they were pretty banged up too. I found out at gametime that Lane Johnson, their stud RT (from Oklahoma &#8211; boomer), is still inactive. Their backfield was much less dangerous than it could have been, as Ajayi and Sproles remain out. Most notably was their secondary – Jalen Mills and Sidney Jones were both out, and midgame Ronald Darby was also injured and left the game. I didn’t know all of this at the time, and so I figured that the Eagles would probably school us.</p>
<p>I think the biggest early tone setter was the interception by Leighton Vander Esch (LVE, from now on, because his name is long and I’m lazy). LVE’s pick put us in the red zone, where we promptly kicked a field goal, as per last week. Well, last week we missed the field goal, but whatever. Throughout most of the first half, the defense was pretty solid. Philly didn’t really have much of a running game, and went for it on fourth down early on and was unable to convert. In contrast, Dallas faked a punt at its own 31 from fourth and 2, with a direct snap to Jeff Heath, normally at safety. That was a pretty nuts call that nobody is talking about – I don’t think anybody was expecting that. However, the buzz was that Dallas was playing like the season was on the line (it kind of still is, to be honest), so some tricks were to be expected. That one worked perfectly.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" src="https://streamable.com/s/3uode/jxslid" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dallas and Philly traded field goals and the score was 6 to 3. In the Dallas drive, Elliott hurdles a dude who is standing pretty much straight up and almost scores, which is fucking insane. If he had scored it would have been play of the year, no question. With about a minute and a half left before halftime, I thought we had a chance to get another field goal and go up 9 to 3, but that hope was quickly extinguished with a pretty big sack that put us at second and 23. That is, until we ran a pretty excellent screen call to Michael Gallup, which was well blocked and got us the first down on third and 15. From there, the drive was executed perfectly, and I felt pretty optimistic about a 13 to 3 lead at halftime, and getting the ball back right afterwards.</p>
<p>Coming out of halftime, we ran a naked bootleg that was immediately blown up for a nine yard sack. What the fuck, Linehan? Can we stop running that play? It never works. I’ve seen that play get blown up at least four times by different teams this season. Everybody knows it’s coming. Everyone has seen it on film. It’s apparently extremely predictable. Stop doing it. We punt and Philly goes down and kicks a field goal. We go down and miss a field goal. I miss Dan Bailey, a little. Then, the next four drives are touchdown touchdown touchdown touchdown. Ertz gets both of the Eagles touchdowns, and Ian forgets what team he’s rooting for in the middle of the game, because F A N T A S Y. Elliott gets both of the Cowboys touchdowns.</p>
<p>It is now 27 to 20, and the Eagles are driving. There’s three minutes and some change left in the game. Philly had been kind of getting whatever they wanted in the passing game, especially with Ertz against Awuzie/whoever was on him. They get first and ten at the Dallas 38. Philly tries a pass in the flat to Smallwood, who is tracked down by LVE. Second down, Wentz scrambles for five when we cover pretty well. Third down, after the two minute warning, was the play of the game (according to Collinsworth, and I agree). Philly tries another lateral pass to Corey Clement, and they’ve got their two blockers in position against only LVE, who is kind of out of position and about to be swallowed up. Looks like an easy first. It wasn’t, though, because LVE outruns both blockers before they can get him, and drops Clement for a five yard loss, setting up fourth and seven. It was pretty legit – the type of play you expect Sean Lee to make, but LVE filled in very nicely and did the job for him. The Eagles had no chance but to go for it on fourth down, and were stopped short on a pass to Ertz by the always solid Jeff Heath. The rest of the game was pretty uneventful, and the Cowboys go on to win 27 to 20.</p>
<p>This was a game that started defensively and turned into a rather entertaining NFC East bout in the second half, with the good guys coming out on top. What more could you ask for from a Cowboys Eagles matchup?</p>
<p>In this next section, it’s time to talk about Fantasy Playoff Picture. It’s week 10, so there are three weeks left in the season. The trade deadline is Wednesday, November 21<sup>st</sup>, at 11AM (not this week, but next), so if you have trades to make, it’s time to get them in. Let’s take a look at the standings:</p>

<p>I think the best way to break this down is by tier, and then team. We’ll start with the likeliest teams to make playoffs this year, the 7 and 3 teams.</p>
<p><strong>Commissioner Gordon</strong>: Sidd’s team, although losing this week, is still wildly ahead on PF compared to the next highest team, which gives him an advantage down the stretch, if he were to go on a losing streak. His last three games are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jaiden</li>
<li>Thomas</li>
<li>Anthony</li>
</ul>
<p>Jaiden’s team has revitalized itself with the return of Fournette, but I think Sidd is still the favorite in that game. Thomas’s team is injury ravaged and on bye hell this week, but not really all that good – I’d consider that a solid W for Sidd, even with Gurley on BYE that week. Anthony’s team is wildly unpredictable, so I’d say lean W but probably still a win. Even if Sidd loses to both Jaiden and Anthony, his team would only fall to 8 and 5, which would still put him in the playoffs. I think he’s most likely to go 9 and 4, putting him in good position for a BYE with tiebreaks.</p>
<p><strong>Jake From Saquon</strong>: Ian’s team has these matchups down the stretch:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mike</li>
<li>James</li>
<li>Jaiden</li>
</ul>
<p>None of these games are sure victories. Ian’s schedule down the stretch is the toughest of the top tier. However,  Ian’s team has been very strong, so it wouldn’t surprise me if he did win all three. I’d say he’s likely to win two of the three – pick your favorite two. That would put him at 9 and 4, solidly in the playoffs and in contention for first round BYE. If he wins all three, he would get a first round BYE for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh Holdouts: </strong>My team is on a pretty solid winning streak, although my score cooled down this week. My last three games are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oron</li>
<li>Ian</li>
<li>Dame</li>
</ul>
<p>My schedule is pretty easy down the stretch, with Oron and Dame as likely W’s. Versus Ian is a tossup game, as his team has been very strong lately with the exception of his BYE hell week. My most likely regular season outcome is either 9 and 4 (if I win two of the three) or 10 and 3 (if I go undefeated), which will certainly guarantee me a playoff spot and maybe a first round BYE.</p>
<p>Next, we have the six and four teams – teams who are currently in, but not guaranteed a playoff spot by any means.</p>
<p><strong>Benny and the Fournettes: </strong>Jaiden’s upcoming schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sidd</li>
<li>Oron</li>
<li>Ian</li>
</ul>
<p>Jaiden is tricky to predict, considering that he just went off this week. However, I’m gonna go ahead and guess that he loses two of his last three matchups (the ones against top tier teams Sidd and Ian). This would put him in a tough spot at 7 and 6. He needs to beat one of Ian or Sidd, which would put him at 8 and 5 assuming he takes care of Oron in week 12. This would definitely push him into the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Taco Johnny’s: </strong>Chris has the following matchups in the last three weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anthony</li>
<li>Justin</li>
<li>Mike</li>
</ul>
<p>Pencil in Justin as a win. With David Johnson coming on, and AJ Green in a boot, the matchup vs Anthony is maybe a bit slanted towards Chris, but is still a tossup. Vs. Mike will be a challenge as well, but I’d give Chris the advantage in that one too, considering that Cooper Kupp is out for the season, and Gronk has been out more times than not. We’ll see how he does after the BYE. I’d say Chris is most likely to get 2 of 3 wins, putting him at 8 and 5.</p>
<p><strong>Dame’s Daddy: </strong>Mike’s team had a good showing this week, but lost Cooper Kupp. Upcoming matchups are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ian</li>
<li>Dame</li>
<li>Chris</li>
</ul>
<p>Mike is likely to beat Damian, but will face Ian and Chris down the stretch. This week will be the first win that Mike has had in a while. I think it will be tough for Mike to get a second win down the stretch, but we will see. Most likely to finish 7 and 6, a second win would push him into the playoffs for sure</p>
<p>Finally, the five and five “bubble” teams.</p>
<p><strong>Alabama Heisman House: </strong>Reece’s last few games:</p>
<ul>
<li>Thomas</li>
<li>Anthony</li>
<li>Justin</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the two bubble teams, Reece certainly has the easier schedule. Reece is a clear favorite in two matchups, and vs. Anthony I’d give the advantage to Reece as well. Even as a bubble team, I think his playoff odds aren’t too bad. Probably at least 7 and 6, maybe 8 and 5.</p>
<p><strong>You need WR’s in PPR right?:</strong> Anthony’s remaining matchups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chris</li>
<li>Reece</li>
<li>Sidd</li>
</ul>
<p>Anthony’s having his worst showing in a while, and he has a tough schedule down the stretch. For the bubble teams, you need to get as many wins as possible to have a playoff chance. 7 wins is possibly in the playoffs, 8 wins is basically guaranteed. That said, I think Anthony loses to Sidd and Chris here, and Reece is no gimme either. Anthony has longshot odds of making it.</p>
<p>That’s the overall picture, with likeliest contenders for playoffs (IMO) being Sidd, me, Ian, Chris, and then two of three for Jaiden/Mike/Reece (sorry Anthony!). That said, I will probably be totally wrong on the last few spots, because football is random and any attempts to predict anything only jinx everything. I’ll probably get scorched by Oron 150-50 next week, lose the last two games, and miss playoffs on tiebreaks because I tried to predict anything.</p>
<p>Now, the regulars.</p>
<p><strong>Top Team: </strong>Like I was saying, Ian’s team is looking pretty strong lately. Andrew Luck got off to a slow start, but hasn’t had a sub-20 point week since week 3 (and he’s only QB8?). Barkley is Barkley, but was actually a bit less Barkley than usual vs the Niners. Howard… Keenan Allen was solid, and has been trending up after a slow start forced his previous owner to ditch him in a stupid trade (won’t name names). Larry Fitzgerald is back in a starting lineup for a week until Adam Thielen returns. But the two best players this week were Zach Ertz, who was unguardable in the second half vs. the Cowboys, and Aaron Jones. Remember what I said about never trusting a Green Bay backfield? Guess I was wrong, because Aaron Jones is the guy in Green Bay, and he was a monster vs. Miami. Another thing I always say is that you don’t have 30 point games on accident if you’re a running back, but with the Packers, it’s tough to say if Aaron Jones will continue to be a focal point of an offense that has Aaron Rodgers in it. Jones is of course a solid start going forward, however.</p>
<p><strong>Highest-Scoring Loser: </strong>Good thing I wasn’t playing Reece this week. Dude would have beaten everyone except Ian and the guy he played against, Jaiden. Talk about bad luck. But what’s not bad luck is the trade that he made with Damian during experience week. Do not give Reece your players, because they instantly turn into studs as soon as you sell them. Such was the case with Christian McCaffrey, the scrappy lunch-pail coach’s son with a high motor and a great football IQ. Gym rats, I’m out of white athlete euphemisms. Dude put up almost 35 last week which is the best he’s done all season. Probably ever.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest-Scoring Winner: </strong>I bet it’s me, I bet it’s me… IT’S NOT ME! It’s Dame, and god dameit did he need a win. Go ahead, groan, but Damian’s second victory of the season would have still beat just about every other loser (except Reece of course). So he’s not really that low scoring of a winner. I mean, he eclipsed the century mark this week! So yeah, you traded away your best player and got shit in return, but at least you won! Who needs playoffs, anyways… :sadcat:</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel: </strong>Oh, how the mighty are not mighty anymore. That’s the phrase, right? Thomas didn’t start a kicker this week, so he’s clearly not paying attention anymore. I may have to set his lineups going forward. But even if he did start Chris Boswell, his team is just the worst this year. His best player was Ryan Fitzpatrick, who scored 13.7. None of his players eclipsed 15 points, and only three made it to double digits. Rough year for the former champ.</p>
<p><strong>Best Player: </strong>Jaiden’s namesake, Big Ben Roethlisberger, did some uncouth things to the Panthers defense on Thursday night. Without even waiting, he took his chances and dove right in, scoring not once, not twice, but five times that night. But look, you might say – the Panthers were asking for it. Who just leaves their corners exposed like that? At least cover them up with a safety. Perhaps Cam Newton’s decision making was impaired. At any rate, that’s no excuse for the behavior that Ben exhibited. No “no” doesn’t mean “yes.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>Was that poor taste? I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start: </strong>Said Panthers D that got raped by Big Ben. RIP Justin.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench: </strong>Thomas’s kicker wasn’t a good bench. Set your lineups, please. But we’re gonna go with Allen Robinson (Reece). If Reece had played the WR1 of the Bears instead of the WR…3? of the Packers, he would have beaten Jaiden. Oh well, Robinson was coming off of an injury, and it’s tough to start someone the same week that happens.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge: </strong>This week’s challenge was to outperform your projections! So, $5 goes to Ian, who was projected for 113.2 but scored 141.8, a difference of 28.6! Nice going, Ian.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hello boys it is time for the week (whatever) writeup by yours truly, Oron.</p>
<p>Since I can fit my knowledge of football inside my shitty jeans pocket that’s above the actual pocket, I decided to grace all of you with some knowledge about this up and coming esport game called League of Legends (LoL for short). For those of you who are unfamiliar, the basics behind LoL are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>5v5 head to head combat</li>
<li>Each player picks a “champion”, a character with unique abilities and mechanics</li>
<li>Players have positions on a team, defined by 3 lanes: 1 Top, 1 Mid, 2 Bottom, and a roaming Jungler</li>
<li>The main goal is to take down structures such as turrets and eventually, the enemy Nexus (their base), through pushing their lanes in with accompanying CPU minions, and killing the other players.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that you have the basics, I will give you some background on the history. League was first released in 2009 with only a handful of champions to choose from, and now, almost a decade later has 141 champions, and can be considered one of the most popular video games of the current era. League has had its own world championship, called Worlds for short, where teams representing different region in the world compete against each other. This Worlds was particularly exciting (at the beginning at least) because one of the most successful teams, didn’t even make it in. SKT, 3 time Worlds champions, lost in the semifinals of the previous year, and seem to have not yet recover from that loss, not even being able to qualify for the tournament this year. With regards to which region will take it home, normally everyone would assume it would be Korea (SKT is from there), but with SKT’s downfall and no other major Korean teams who have seriously proven their mettle, the playing field would prove to be more level this time around.</p>
<p>Now I was going to write about the tournament, but fucking China won when there were three other Western teams in semifinals, so I am FUCKING SALTY. So instead here is some ranting about specific champions that Justin and Reece might enjoy while the rest of you can skip if you so wish.</p>
<p>Also, I am writing this part while being on call with work on a Sunday night :blobsweat:</p>
<p>First up, Fiora:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://imgur.com/DFfjJkr.jpg" width="563" height="316" /></p>
<p>This GODDAMN fucking bitch of a champion is the main reason I quit toplane. This bitch gets true damage without cooldown and A PARRY. Not only does this bitch deal damage she gets tanky too, and if she is able to proc her ult (ultimate ability) on you she becomes an unstoppable, dash spamming PIECE OF SHIT.</p>
<p>Next, we have fan service for Justin, Fizz:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://imgur.com/sMdkaJj.jpg" width="563" height="316" /></p>
<p>This PIECE OF SHIT (I like using this one a lot) is a slippery champion that can one-shot you and then get away scot free. Fizz packs an incredible punch throughout the early and mid-game and, if fed, the late game as well. Some might call this guy anti-fun because his kit is so un-interactive because he has a lot of movement and a lot of damage, combined with invulnerability on one of his abilities. The only things that really stop Fizz early game is cooldowns, knowing how to bait his abilities out in the early game for kill pressure is crucial. But he’s still a piece of shit.</p>
<p>Lastly, because I know most of y’all don’t read this anyway, Master Yi:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://imgur.com/keB5aKa.jpg" width="292" height="172" /></p>
<p>Ligma.</p>
<p>Now, on to the real stuff, FOOTBALL:</p>
<p><strong>Oron vs. Justin</strong></p>
<p>Justin said he was gonna beat my ass and boy did he. Both Michael Thomas and Tevin Coleman decided to output a whole bunch of fucking yards, both breaking 30 points. Meanwhile my star player that I got off waivers because my QB was on BYE, Baker Mayfield scored a measly 18 points, arguably average for a QB. That, in combination with the fact that my players apparently suck now, has produced an overwhelming loss on my part. Good job Justin you said you’d beat my ass and weren’t proven wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Damian vs. Thomas</strong></p>
<p>Natty vs. Natty, someone might think this would be a close one, given the track record. However, Dame once again has proven he done did pretty shiddy. Damian traded away his namesake, Christian McCaffrey (I spelled it right I looked it up), to Reece of all people and lo and behold the Law of Reece was invoked once again. McCaffrey had a fantastic run this week, too bad Dame traded him <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f60a.png" alt="😊" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Thomas had a robust roster, with 4 out of 9 slots producing double digits, special mention to the Dolphins defense putting up a whopping 24 points! Meanwhile Dame’s lineup was just kinda, average? I’m not good at this part ok? Even with Thomas having a 0 point slot on his bench he was able to overcome Damian’s lineup with ease. Better luck next time Damian, may the trade gods turn the tides in your favor.</p>
<p><strong>Mike vs. Sidd/Saul</strong></p>
<p>Shut Sidd, you don’t need LeVeon Bell actually playing this season (thanks James &gt;.&gt;). Mike didn’t have a tight end this week, however I doubt Gronk would have bridge the massive gap Sidd has forged with his lineup. Another remarkable defense on Sidd’s lineup, the Vikings D with 23 points, as well as Sidd’s usual performers giving expected results; Pat Mahomes, Todd Gurley, and Melvin Gordon all performed well, along with George Kittle (who let this man pick up so many good players). Over on Mike’s side… Well at least you could’ve beat half of the other losers this week so I’d chalk it up to bad luck, except y’know, when you didn’t get a tight end.</p>
<p><strong>Jaiden vs. Chris</strong></p>
<p>A very close match, however it was Jaiden’s defense that cost him this W. Jaiden had a great core with Roethlisberger (fucking hell), and Kamara, along with help from Greg Olsen and Devante Adams. However, if the Rams D had actually produced positive points, he might have had this one in the bag. Chris on the other hand took no prisoners with 6 out of 9 slots producing double digits, with exceptional, albeit expected, performance from Kareem Hunt. A narrow fight with good performers on both sides, this is what fantasy football should look like.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony vs. Ian</strong></p>
<p>‘Member when we all made fun of Thony for cashing out on WR’s? Well it’s coming back to bite us in the ass. Anthony has proven himself to be a major competitor in this league, gaining a few star players through trades while maintaining high value on his roster. I don’t know how he did it, but this is where it’s at right now. Ian on the other hand, traded 2 bums for someone I thought would remain a bum, Keenan Allen. But alas, I am a dumbass, Keenan put up a good 18 points this week, whoop de doo James you were right to roast my trade. Looks like Ian wasn’t really trying to win this one, he left his tight end spot empty as well. Oh well ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p><strong>James vs. Reece</strong></p>
<p>HOT DAMN James you’re pretty good at this thing. James’s roster produced 143 points this week, the highest for this matchup week. Now as much as I love seeing Reece lose, I have to admit he got the short end of the stick on this one. His team would have been able to beat half of the league so he just kinda got fukt, sorry. James was carried to victory by one of his early waiver pickups, James Conner, everyone’s favorite cancer survivor (for real though fuck cancer, no one should have to go through an experience like it). James has proven his football IQ is pretty good, as Conner has been paying dividends this entire season., also they have the same first name.</p>
<p><strong>Top Team:</strong></p>
<p>James put up 143.3 points! Good job my dude.</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scoring Loser:</strong></p>
<p>Reece, with 109.7, sorry bud you got a bit unlucky this week.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest Scoring Winner:</strong></p>
<p>Thomas, with 108.3, would have lost to Jaiden who had 108.4.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player:</strong></p>
<p>Michael Thomas with 33.1, nice work Justin.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start:</strong></p>
<p>Ian you didn’t start a tight end, shame.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench:</strong></p>
<p>Mike, with 46 points left on this bench, if you had started Jared Goff and Calvin Ridley, plus a tight end, you might have been able to edge out SIdd!</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel:</strong></p>
<p>Damian, I’m so sorry <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2639.png" alt="☹" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />, but at least our superlatives are super diverse this week!</p>
<p>Now I’ll turn it over back to James, it has been my pleasure writing up this writeup for y’all.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Fantasy Football Writeup</p>
<p>What’s up my dudes, it’s your boi Justin here with your weekly fantasy football writeup. I’m not the best writer, so hopefully you’ll be able to get through all of this. Also, like Sidd, I did not feel like proof-reading this. Especially because I wrote it at work. If there’s anything that I learned from James, it’s that you don’t have to write about the NFL at all in these writeups, save for the weekly awards (and shamings). So, naturally, we’re going to talk NBA basketball (side note, why do people say NBA basketball? Isn’t that redundant?).</p>
<p>Naturally, I’ll start off with the greatest team in the NBA, the Dallas Mavericks (because honestly I haven’t watched many other teams). If you haven’t watched any of the Mavs games this year, I highly recommend it. Luka makes DeAndre Jordan look like an All-NBA center again, while putting up points himself too. It’s a very fast paced offense with lots of lobs, mostly to DeAndre, Dwight Powell, and occasionally to Dennis Smith Jr. himself. It is very exciting to watch, and I’m looking forward to what they do this season (also we’re over 500 for the first time since April 2016).</p>
<p>Actually, I lied. We aren’t really talking in depth at all about other teams. Since I haven’t watched many other games, I think I’ll just make my predicitions/hot takes/cold takes/lukewarm takes/idk takes for this season.</p>
<p><strong>Luka wins Rookie of the Year</strong></p>
<p>“Wow Justin, what a surprise, you picked Luka to win ROY!” Yes, yes I know I’m a massive homer. But from what I’ve seen from him, Luka is the real deal. He has court vision like no other, seems to be able to get to the basket and finish whenever he feels like it, and has a solid jumper. His defense is actually better than I expected too. He’s streaky, which is a concern. I think he’ll have some bad games and some good games, but will come out of it looking like the best rookie this year. He also has the narrative going for him (coming in as the Euroleague MVP), which is super important when winning league awards.</p>
<p>I will give credit to other rookies as well. Trae Young has shown that he can <em>definitely</em> put up numbers, and Deandre Ayton will definitely be a beast in this league. Bagley looks good too, but he needs more consistent minutes (and honestly, a better team). I think a dark horse will be Jaren Jackson Jr. (who I had at number 3 on my draft board), he’s looking niiiiiice. His defensive instincts are really good and he is shooting well. I’m excited to see what this class will do.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--F4D5z4KA--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/fbaeqpjate5ozhkl3ylw.jpg" width="800" height="515" /></p>
<p><strong>Giannis wins MVP</strong></p>
<p>This one is for you Mike. The narrative is there. The numbers are there. The coach to make it happen is there. I just don’t see anyone else breaking out to the Giannis’s level (maybe Jokic, but the narrative isn’t there for him yet). Voters won’t want to give it to Harden again (they seem to hate voting for him). I think he got it last year because he really should have gotten it the year Westbrook got it (@ me, I dare you) and voters wanted to make up for it. Nobody on the Warriors will win MVP because they balance each other out, and the Lakers aren’t going to be a high enough seed for LeBron to win. The only person who might take it from him is Anthony Davis, and he has a really good shot. It will really come down to how they play, but I’m predicting Giannis over AD right now, especially considering AD’s injury history. Nobody else in the league right now really strikes me as an MVP caliber player, which is why I think it will be Giannis. Fight me.</p>
<p><strong>The Timberwolves Don’t Trade Jimmy Butler</strong></p>
<p>I don’t know why I have this feeling, but something about the dumbness of Thibs tells me that he is going to hold on to Jimmy. This may be because he’s an awful GM and think’s he can get more for Jimmy, or because he thinks he can re-sign Jimmy this offseason (spoilers: he can’t). If I’m wrong about this one, Thibs will trade him for pennies on the dollar and everyone will laugh. Sorry Dame.</p>
<p>Of course, this all goes out the window when he (hopefully) gets fired.</p>
<p><strong>The Blazers Miss the Playoffs</strong></p>
<p>Another gut feeling one. No justification really.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://mavs-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/GettyImages-1037475878-826x620.jpg" width="826" height="620" /></p>
<p><strong>DeAndre Jordan makes the All Star Team</strong></p>
<p>More homerism, but his stats are really good right now. He’s a walking double-double, and Carlisle really knows how to use him. I initially had this prediction as an All-NBA team, but I had a hard time saying that he would be a top 3 center in the NBA. Embiid, Jokic, and KAT are all going to better than him. But if he keeps it up, DeAndre will make the All Star team. Probably. Maybe. We’ll see.</p>
<p>Enough rambling about the NBA, let’s get into the actual fantasy football stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Best Team:</strong></p>
<p>Big surprise here, Sidd with another ridiculous outing from his team. Why did we let this man pick up Latavius Murray? Not that it mattered, he still would have put up over 130 without him. I’m honestly not sure how anybody is going to beat Sidd this year. I am definitely not looking forward to my matchup with him; it’ll take a miracle for a win for me.</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scoring Loser:</strong></p>
<p>This award goes out to Jaiden this week, narrowly beating me out by 0.6 points. To be honest, Jaiden, there’s not a whole lot you can do when Ian puts up 140 points. Almost every player on Ian’s team went off (including Saquon and his thick thighs <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f351.png" alt="🍑" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />). Better luck next week, hopefully we can both pull out some dubs.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest Scoring Winner:</strong></p>
<p>Thomas! You did it! Lucky for you, Oron’s team was garbage this week, with his highest scorer being Carson Wentz with 18 points. Assuming his injured players come back (and maybe some more trades?), I wouldn’t be surprised if Thomas makes a push to get back to 500. Yet at the same time, I would be very surprised if it actually happens. Only time will tell. With this win, you leave Damian down in the dumps, alone at the bottom of the league. RIP the Natty boys L</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://blacksportsonline.com/home/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/Gronk-on-Cart.png" width="598" height="307" /></p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel:</strong></p>
<p>Even if Dame is the bottom of the league this week, it was, in fact, his Daddy that was the bottom of the barrel in terms of scoring! Sorry in advance for the roasting, Mike, but I just want to emphasize how bad your team was this week. Granted, the Grand Daddy himself was on bye, but the rest of your team absolutely did not pick up the slack. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen a team not break 50 points (although I wouldn’t be surprised if I did it last year or will do it this year). Worst of all, you knew Gronk was hurt, that’s why you picked up a backup tight end. So why in the world did you still start Gronk! Benjamin Watson would have gotten you another 13 points, allowing you to break 50 points and avoid this embarrassment. You could have given Oron a run for his money for worst team this week. I will admit thought, you had some really awful luck this week with your team, so I hope things turn around for you next week.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://i.imgur.com/7XJyoO5.jpg" width="496" height="380" /></p>
<p>(Kareem of the Crop. Google “cream of the crop Randy Savage” if you don’t get it)</p>
<p><strong>Top Player:</strong></p>
<p>This week’s top player is Kareem Hunt, on Chris’s team (and mine in my other league J). The man was a tuddie machine this week, thanks to the high powered Andy Reid offense. I would expect to see more games like this one, assuming Patrick Mahomes keeps finding him with his passes.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start:</strong></p>
<p>So <em>technically</em> this “award” should go to Thomas this week for starting the Bills defense, who scored -2 points. So for all intents and purposes, it goes to Thomas. However, I feel that it spiritually goes to Mike for starting Rob Gronkowski when he knew that he was not playing this week. I feel like starting a player that is ­<em>guaranteed</em> to get you 0 points is worse than starting a defense that is just bad and let up too many points. I’ll let you decide. Also honorable mention goes out to me for starting LeSean McCoy, who got me 0.1 points. At least he got the one yard.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench:</strong></p>
<p>In terms of points, James benching Trubisky in favor of Brees would be the “worst bench,” missing out on 15 points. However, I can’t blame him for making this decision. I still want to call Mike benching Benjamin Watson the worst bench this week, leaving 13 points on the bench. I’ll let you decide this one too.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge:</strong></p>
<p>This week’s challenge was the most points forced through the first half of the season. Congratulations Sidd, you get another $5. Whoop-de-freakin-do. Now that you’ve won the weekly challenge multiple times, it just wouldn’t be fair for you to take more of the pot by winning the league. Just hand over Gurley and we can call it even. Real talk though, Sidd beat the next highest opponent by 88 points. He also beat me by 280 points, but continues to tell me “nah bro you can make the playoffs still.” Whatver you say Sidd. Whatever you say.</p>
<p>That about wraps it up for this week’s writeup. I’ve been your guest, Justin Katz, hopefully you put up with all of the random stuff I spewed out this week. Thanks for reading.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s 11 AM on <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Columbus</span> Indigenous Peoples Day, and I’m writing the general section of the week 6 writeup about a week in advance because it’s fresh in my mind. I really, really need to get my thoughts down on paper about this Mike Stoops thing. Most of you guys (except for Thomas) probably don’t follow OU football all that closely, and so seeing us let our defensive coordinator go in the middle of the season after a close loss to a Texas program who may be “back” (still too early to tell in my opinion – once you win a Big 12 championship you can be back) might be seen as a bad move. But to me, and everybody else who has followed OU for the last four or five years, and has seen all of Mike Stoops’s game as a defensive coordinator in his second stint, this move has been needed for a long time.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FkGjkyQvNb307O5CUnhfLdX_-MQ=/0x54:4326x2938/920x613/filters:focal(0x54:4326x2938):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/48498941/GettyImages-460218913.0.jpg" width="920" height="613" /></p>
<p>Let’s wind the clocks back four years, to 2014. In 2014, Oklahoma was coming off the high of winning the Sugar Bowl with their seemingly star quarterback, Trevor Knight. On the offensive side of the ball, we had Sterling Shepard, in his third season with the team, as our best receiver. Additionally, we had the up and coming freshman, Samaje Perine, who would go on to break the single game rushing record later that year vs. Kansas. We had a dominant offensive line, filled with seniors. On the defensive side of the ball, our best player was our outside linebacker and pass rush specialist, Eric Striker. Striker was also coming off of a fantastic Sugar Bowl showing, in which he abused the Alabama left tackle, Arie Kouandjio, getting a fantastic jump on the final drive and forcing a fumble to end the game. Our strength on the defensive side of the ball was our ability to get pressure, with guys like Striker, Charles Tapper (on the Cowboys until this season), Geneo Grissom (Patriots), and Jordan Phillips (Dolphins, Bills). Most of this was due to the work of our Defensive Line coach at the time, Jerry Montgomery, now with the Green Bay Packers.</p>
<p>Our defense’s question mark coming into the season was the secondary. We had Zach Sanchez, a redshirt sophomore, returning as a starter. Zach was a decent cover guy and an interception machine. However, our lockdown corner from the previous year, Aaron Colvin (Jags, Texans), left to the NFL, so we needed to fill the other side. We were also down our senior-most safety, Gabe Lynn. We filled up the starting secondary with Julian Wilson as the other corner, a senior who switched positions, and slotted in Ahmad Thomas at free safety. The strong safety, Quentin Hayes, was a returning starter and senior.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full" src="https://www.latimes.com/resizer/XpQC7si9VhfkZCtj7il8D9ujz2A=/1400x0/www.trbimg.com/img-5434004b/turbine/la-katy-perry-trevor-knight-20141007" width="1400" height="817" /></p>
<p>A lot of things happened that year. There was the Katy Perry curse – Sooner fans joke that her appearance on Gameday and proclamation of infatuation for TK9 resulted in his downfall as a football player – it did immediately proceed an upset loss to TCU on the road. OU lost at home to Kansas State after Michael Hunnicutt, our kicker at the time, missed several kicks including a blocked extra point late in the game which caused OU to lose by one. Later in the year, OU would lose a Bedlam game at home (we lost three games at home this year!) after choosing after a penalty to re-punt the ball to Tyreek Hill, who immediately housed the punt and forced OT. Then they would get blown out by Clemson in the bowl game. However, the game I’d like to focus on is a bout at home vs. Baylor.</p>
<p>Baylor in 2014 was probably the peak of the Art Briles era. Their offense was the scariest in the Big 12, even more so than TCU, who they would eventually be co-champions with. Their quarterback was Bryce Petty, and their receivers included Antwan Goodley, Corey Coleman, and K.D. Cannon. Coleman and Cannon were both five star recruits, and Goodley was a senior with good speed and RAC potential. You know, looking at this receiving corps now, they didn’t end up amounting to much in the NFL, for how much we were afraid of them. Coleman was a first round pick, sure, but he was cut by the Browns this season (and by the Patriots later this season). Goodley and Cannon went undrafted and never made a roster.</p>
<p>I attended this game in the student section, not as a marching band member. After the 2013 season, I decided that I was done with band, and wanted to focus on my studies, but I still wanted to go to the games. I went to just about every home game except Kansas that year, because it was pouring (insert fair-weather fan joke here). The game started off pretty solidly in OU’s favor. Baylor came at OU with a balanced attack, and we used blitz packages to get Bryce Petty out of his comfort zone. OU took a 14-3 lead after  a few solid defensive possessions. Then, in the second quarter, things started to unravel for the Sooners. Baylor put together a solid drive, as Petty hit Coleman for their first touchdown of the day. Trevor Knight threw a pick-almost-six which Baylor converted on the next play. Hunnicutt missed a field goal. But it was the Baylor drive right before halftime in which they started to notice a glaring weakness in our defensive scheme, specifically in regards to the way our defensive backs were playing. I think the thing that keyed them to it was our alignment on a fourth and four.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" src="/ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4and4.png" alt="" width="1085" height="549" srcset="/ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4and4.png 1085w, /ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4and4-300x152.png 300w, /ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4and4-768x389.png 768w, /ff-writeup/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/4and4-1024x518.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 706px) 89vw, (max-width: 767px) 82vw, 740px" /></p>
<p>We had a nickel package, with six guys at the line of scrimmage to disguise where the pressure was coming from. But four of our five guys were aligned eight yards off the ball! And it was fourth and four! When the ball is snapped, all five of our guys backpedal. Petty quickly throws to Jay Lee on the left side, but he could have hit any of his five receivers for a first down. Baylor continues with its balanced attack on this drive and eventually scores a touchdown, but at this point, I think that Art Briles and his offensive coordinators were already planning what they were going to do on the next drive. It just so happened to come after halftime.</p>
<p>Then, it happened. The absolute worst drive, from a defensive perspective, that I’ve ever seen on Owen Field. Let me first give you guys a disclaimer: I have never played football. In terms of my knowledge of football defense, schemes, etc., I’d say that I know a little more than the average person, but obviously anybody who’s played or coached football probably knows more than me. But it was so obvious what was happening on the field, that I bet that everyone in that stadium that day could have told Mike what was going wrong. We in the student section couldn’t believe what we were seeing. It was incredible. I&#8217;ve linked the video below, at the appropriate timestamp, but I&#8217;m going to describe it anyways.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Bav_8p0xgs?start=5824" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Baylor lines up in empty. 0-0 personnel, with five receivers. OU shows a similar look to that fourth and four play in the first half. When the snap occurs, OU brings six, but Petty calmly and quickly puts the ball on Corey Coleman, who picks up six yards. Second and four. OU shows a more traditional look, with linebackers off the LOS, but still with some cushion, so Petty again throws to the outside for the easy first down. On the game broadcast, the commentators make mention of what’s going on, noting that Oklahoma has let Baylor get easy yardage twice in a row with their cushion off the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p>First down. Same empty set, same pressure look with cushion. Same result. Now, more of us in the stands are starting to see what’s happening on the field, and are starting to get angry. “Baylor will do that all the way down the field if you let them,” says one commentator. Second down. We give the same look, but this time Ahmad Thomas comes forward instead of backpedaling, limiting the gain to only two yards. Third down. DBs are aligned five yards to seven yards off the line of scrimmage again, safety is at twelve yards. This time, we bring four, and drop into cover four, but Petty finds a window and Coleman again.</p>
<p>First down. Again we bring pressure, again we leave cushion. Petty hits Goodley on a wide open slant and gets thirteen. To us in the stands, it feels like Baylor is just moving down the field with ease. All of the throws are quick and easy, and our guys are not contesting anything. We might as well not even be on the field, we’re just letting them dink and dunk their way to the endzone. Our defense’s strength, the pressure guys, are just so totally neutralized by our shitty alignment in the secondary that they don’t even matter.</p>
<p>First down. We adjust, bringing only three, but our linebacker in coverage (Striker maybe?) is so far away from Corey Coleman that it feels like cushion anyways. Coleman gets the ball and nobody is within five yards of him. Easy five yards. Second down. More cushion, another quick out, and an easy first down. Baylor is now on the fifteen yard line. Now boos can be heard on the broadcast. The fans were livid. I was livid. People were swearing like sailors in the stands, cursing Mike Stoops. Again, it doesn’t take a genius to see when something has as glaring of a weakness as that was.</p>
<p>At this point, Julian Wilson gets angry at Mike and Bob. You can see him on the broadcast come over and say something to the Stoops brothers, who return fire, telling him to get back out on the field or something. They return to the same damn alignment, and get beat in the same damn way for ten yards. More boos. “This looks like seven on seven.”</p>
<p>First down. Petty hands the ball off to Corey Coleman, and the linebackers, who have not seen a run all drive, let him walk into the endzone. Touchdown. Baylor leads 31-14.</p>
<p>That game was the biggest home loss in the Bob Stoops era, by point margin. Nobody played well. The offense was atrocious. Trevor Knight eventually got injured and was out for the rest of the regular season. And yet, the thing that sticks out in my memory most about that game was that drive. After the 2014 season, Bob Stoops let go of Josh Heupel and Jay Norvell, the co-offensive coordinators, and hired Lincoln Riley from ECU. Baker Mayfield sat on the sideline and watched that game, as a transfer student on the scout team. Eventually, the offense was corrected, and became the best offense in college football in 2017, led by the best player in college football. But Mike Stoops stayed on as defensive coordinator for four more years. If Mike was any other defensive coordinator, after the 2014 season, do you think he would have stayed on? Most Sooner fans believe otherwise. It becomes difficult to be impartial when the coordinator in question is in your immediate family.</p>
<p>Mike Stoops would go on to have many more stinker games as a defensive coordinator. Versus Tulsa in 2015. Versus Texas Tech in 2016. Versus Baylor in 2017. Versus Oklahoma State in 2017. Versus Georgia in the Rose Bowl. And this year, it’s easier to name the games which haven’t been stinkers than the ones that have. Any time a team gets into the red zone, might as well just give them seven points. We need teams to beat themselves with penalties to even have a chance of stopping them. We give up third and 20 on the reg. It’s the most frustrating thing to be on the road, listening to a game on the radio, where you hear this team consistently giving up five to eight yards per carry versus Army, but it’s worse to hear them convert third and twelve passing when they do it maybe once every twenty plays. In the Red River game, Texas did not punt until the second half. Oklahoma is tied for last in red zone scoring percentage – they have never stopped a team from scoring once they got into the red zone. Of those 21 red zone scores, 18 of them are touchdowns. On only three red zone attempts did we force a field goal. Once against Baylor to end the half, and twice against Iowa State. And we haven’t even played teams that I would consider offensive juggernauts yet.</p>
<p>Anyways. Congrats to Texas on the win at the shootout. Thanks for giving us a reason to finally rid ourselves of Mike Stoops, even if it’s four years too late.</p>
<p>And now, this.</p>
<p><strong>Best Team: </strong></p>
<p>Why did we let this happen? Like, it’s the same damn thing as last year, just a different team. We all laughed at the draft. “He’s getting Thomas’s team” we said, after Sidd busted $137 on Gurley and Gordon. We thought that wasting that much money on two guys would cripple his team, as there was no way that Gurley and Gordon would produce as much as they did last year. That $137 turned into 70 points last week. Well, 69.5. Todd Gurley’s ­<em>floor</em> is 22 points. He already has 11 touchdowns so far this season! ELEVEN! We’re not even halfway done with the season! Meanwhile, Melvin Gordon has nine, and his floor is 15 points. That’s disgusting. Admittedly, Sidd didn’t get a lot of help from his receivers this week, and got a nice boost from Gould and the Vikings D. Those scores are somewhat random and unreliable. But Patrick Mahomes? He’s a constant. Guy has been lighting it up the past six weeks. QB1 for the league, with 158.1 points on the season so far. And you know what’s crazy? He has fewer points than Todd Gurley (165.5).</p>
<p><strong>Highest-Scoring Loser</strong></p>
<p>Thomas has had rotten luck. His team hasn’t been super, so far. But his best weeks have come against two of the three 4-2 teams in the league, currently. Jaiden, in week one, beat Thomas 129-128. And this week, Thomas had to face Sidd, who crushed him 156.3-123.7. He had great performances from his quarterback, Jameis Winston, and his best wideout, Hill. But he couldn’t get double digit points from the majority of his team, and ultimately fell short.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest-Scoring Winner</strong></p>
<p>Oron squared off vs. a Kamara and Fournette-less Jaiden,  and had double digit scores from everybody except for Carlos Hyde and Jordan Reed. Also, with the game well in hand, he started Theo Riddick, who didn’t play because his team was on a bye, so this is more of a technicality because he only had eight real players this week. Wooooooooo Oron. Take your damn lunch money.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel</strong></p>
<p>Jaiden, Jaiden, Jaiden. Jaiden. Oh, how the mighty have fallen in their RB1’s bye week. Kamara looked really strong for the first four weeks. Then week 5 rolled around and Ingram came back, and Kamara only picked up 5. Then the bye. Will he return to his former glory? Who knows. All I know, is that everybody else on his team was not good. Well, with the exception of Davante Adams, who put up 30 because the 49ers can’t defend the sidelines. And Big Ben was pretty good too. But Yeldon and the Jags were terrible vs. the stout Cowboys D, Crowell was nowhere to be found in the shootout vs Indy, and Greg Olsen is playing again!?! Guess the foot injury wasn’t too bad. Good for him.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t stay up to watch the Pat vs Pats game. I turned it off in disgust after seeing that the Patriots were double-teaming Kelce all night, and Mahomes failed to reach the endzone for a fourth consecutive time, which put my game out of reach. But (and I think I’ve said this once or twice before), Tyreek Hill is fast. And somehow, he ended up with three TDs by the end of the game, on 7 catches. There’s too many weapons on that team. If Kelce gets double-teamed, Hill has a monster game (and Hunt, too). If you cover Hill with your best corner, Kelce finds the matchups vs the linebackers. It’s hard to scheme against so many good players.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start</strong></p>
<p>Tied between me (Bears D) and Chris (Jags D) this week. Who would have thought that the Bears would give up that many points to Brock Osweiler? Not me. And Dallas finally came alive, showing that nobody holds Dallas under 30 points six games in a row! It was pretty satisfying to see Zeke truck Jalen Ramsey, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench</strong></p>
<p>Partly Mike’s fault, partly not, because Cooper was injured in this game. But not playing Alex Collins was a miss, regardless.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Weekly Challenge </span>Lunch Money</strong></p>
<p>So like, what if everybody went over a hundred points this week? It didn’t happen, but what if? I guess I would just double up on a different week. Anyways, Oron got 99.1 points, making him the victor of this week’s challenge. AND he won his game. Nice going.</p>

<p>Hey guys it&#8217;s your favorite brown-boy. Aka not Warren. Aka Sidd. Aka Squid. Aka The Person WHO FINALLY BEAT DAME. Jk I&#8217;m not actually that proud of that (<em>hides recently printed golden plaque which has October 8th engraved in it</em>). Lets trash talk Dame a little later, shall we?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been doing AWS all day and figured I needed a break, so how else to spend your free time than doing a very in-depth fantasy write-up? eh? no? okay. Well I&#8217;m still gonna do one.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: there will be a lot of typos. This is gonna be too long for me to re-read. Ian I expect a fully curated list of all my typos and you fixing them. Thanks.</p>
<p>For my writeup, I wanted to talk about where we all stand as a league. I still have Fantasy Pros and thought I&#8217;d utilize some of its advanced stats. 5 Weeks into the season we have a good idea of pretty much how all the teams in the league look. I wanted to do an analysis on EACH team and essentially break down their hopes as the season progresses. With that, let&#8217;s start.</p>

<p>Justin was the 6th ranked team post draft. Justin had the 3rd best receivers with Michael Thomas and De&#8217;Andre Hopkins. Justin went with a high end receiver heavy strat (not to the caliber of Anthony but still&#8230;) and that realistically should&#8217;ve paid off in a 0.5 PPR league.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the 2 stud receiver strat didn&#8217;t pay off, and through 5 weeks, according to the power rankings, strength of schedule, and a myriad of other stats, Justin is last in the league in Points For and 3rd highest in PA. Bad scheduling and an underperforming team doesn&#8217;t sit well in fantasy, Justin needs to start trending up, and hopefully quick before the season ends.</p>

<p>Justin pulled the trigger on Hopkins, on a depth achieving trade netting TY Hilton and Tevin Coleman. It took his 2nd best receiver(at the time, Hopkins looks better now) to get the deal done. Hilton is hobbled right now (surprise surprise, Reece trades player who gets injured shortly after) but with Luck at QB, has been having a pretty good season averaging 13pts a game. Coleman is a good flex player who had a lot of stand alone value with Freeman being out. Given Freeman&#8217;s injury history, he&#8217;s a great handcuff, who is able to be flex&#8217;ed. A couple other players like this are Royce Freeman, and Austin Ekeler. Justin should turn it around with the Patriots looking back to their normal self, and Michael Thomas should continue playing well, and hopefully LeSean McCoy figuring out how to run again. Maybe a couple of snow games ought to do it. But if Justin doesn&#8217;t get a win next week, we might see a Michael Thomas trade coming soon.</p>

<p>Oh how the mighty fall. Turns out having Gurley and Gordon on your roster is a pretty good strat. Unfortunately Thomas didn&#8217;t bid his boys up in the draft and waited until Devonta Freeman as his first pick. Freeman has 11 pts in fantasy this year. Due to an injury, we haven&#8217;t seen enough from Freeman and thus the success of Thomas&#8217;s team.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-1" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-1" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>Thomas has a projected record of 5-8, although I do think he&#8217;ll do better, considering he was missing his best RB until now. Freeman needs to stay healthy, and with Coleman right behind him, even a minor injury nets Coleman a higher target share. Freeman is the better back, let&#8217;s not kid ourselves, but much like Thomas, Atlanta is 1-4, and in must-win mode, you know they&#8217;re going to start the healthier player.</p>
<p>Thomas does have the &#8220;Ferrari&#8221; as Joe Buck constantly reminds us every time the Vikings play, in Stefon Diggs. Diggs is a &#8220;reception-whore&#8221; as I like to call it, and when Cousins gets tunnel vision and just passes to one player (be Diggs or Thielen), he&#8217;s extremely dangerous. Diggs and Hill are very explosive, although Tyreek has had some tough matchups recently, with Sherman, Harris and Ramsey covering him the last 3 weeks. But believe me, I&#8217;m a huge Tyreek Hill fan, and looking at Hills schedule, and the fact that Kenyan Drake has been having FRANK GORE take his carries, I think Thomas is gonna string together a couple of wins and in my mind will be in playoff contention in the near future. Drake is going to be much better, I believe as the season progresses who is Thomas&#8217;s X-Factor.</p>

<p>Thomas traded me Woods for Lynch. The original deal was supposed to be Ekeler, but I saw Melvin go down a couple times early in the year, and really wanted to keep Ekeler. I counter-ed with Lynch, who is the better RB of the 2. Thomas didn&#8217;t have room for Woods early on in the season, and considering how depleted I was at reciever, anything over waiver-quality was a win in my books. But holy-hell Robert Woods has been playing like a WR1 this year, and the stats prove it. In a 12 man league he’s got a PRK of 12. Lynch has also been playing well, but the Raiders idiotic play-calling led to this Marshawn Lynch quote, when they decided to throw an interception on a 1st and goal on the 1.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I done seen it happen to me on the game&#8217;s biggest stage. Now it&#8217;s happened to me in regular-season game. It&#8217;s all right though&#8221; -Marshawn Lynch after loss to Chargers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Narrator: &#8220;It definetly wasn&#8217;t alright.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lynch will get the ball more now as knee-jerk reaction to make things better, and that&#8217;ll help Thomas for-sure.</p>

Having said that, this year has been rough fantasy wise for Damian. He&#8217;s got the highest PA in the league. He put up 124 points this week, and still lost. Damian had a very good draft strategy. Draft the Elite RBs. In retrospect 136$ on 2 stud ppr monsters, ought to win you the league. But Dame forgot one thing, and the most important mantra in fantasy that I just made up.</p>

<p>No but really, I&#8217;m shocked that Johnson has been this under-used. Mike Mccoy is the Kevin Sumlin of Running backs coaching. Just like Sumlin has the IQ of a 4 year old when instructing his QB, Mike Mccoy does the same for his RB&#8217;s. David Johnson has 15 Receptions in 5 games. FIF-TEEN. 3 PER GAME. T-H-R-E-E. Fucking Adam Thielen had 14 in one game. But compare him to any other elite RBs such as Gordon, Gurley, Kamara, Elliott, and McCaffery, you&#8217;ll see very clearly where the problem is. Based of his draft value, he has not produced. Mccoy has gone full retard mode in David Johnson&#8217;s usage, and frankly I&#8217;m not sure if he still realizes it. If the Niners didn&#8217;t have a CJ Beathard fumble, DJ wouldn&#8217;t have had an easy 2 yard TD. If DJ comes back to form, averaging 5-7 receptions a game, and re-establishes himself as an integral part of the offense, Dame is gonna be a top 5 team, but if he doesn&#8217;t&#8230;oh boy.. Dame&#8217;s in trouble. I think he will though, someone has to be watching some film in Arizona and saying, &#8220;Jeez Mike, why aren&#8217;t we doing what got us to the NFC Championship game 3 years ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dame traded Wentz for Freeman which gave him more RB depth. Dames reciever have been playing very well, and speaking to Dame&#8217;s knowledge, the acquisition of Tyler Boyd, essentially a WR 2 on waiver, has given him some hope. Tate had an off week this week (thanks Kenny), but I see Dame turning it around. He has a projected record of 5-8. I think he&#8217;ll be some where around there, but if his team plays to his potential, Dame will make the playoffs.</p>

<p>We all laughed at Anthony when he drafted Odell, Julio, and AB as his first 3 picks, and then minimal picks there-after. We chuckled when he went 0-3. And going into last week a matchup against the highest scoring offense in our league with Jaiden, we thought Anthony was doomed. Boy were we wrong. Anthony put up 159.7 PTS. EVERY BODY WENT OFF. Im too lazy to check but I&#8217;m pretty sure thats the largest margin of defeat this year.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-3" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>Anthony has elite WR&#8217;s, let&#8217;s settle that. He also has James White who should be designated as a fucking WR because he had 0 RUSHING YARDS this week. He stands next to Brady and is thus considered a RB. Brady has so many check downs to White, he&#8217;s made him a top 10 fantasy PPR Rb. Absolutely fitting that of all the teams, James White is on Anthonys WR Emporium. What kind of elite rb has 0 rushing yards smh. Anthony listen to me, START. JAMES. WHITE.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-moves-made-3" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#moves-made-3" aria-hidden="true"></a>Moves Made</h3>
<p>Anthony has had quite a bit of moves. Trading Odell for AJ Green and Morris. AJ has been amazing this year as well. Spending literally almost all of his FAAB money on Lindsay and Alex Smith. Lindsay is a RB 2 this year. He&#8217;s played very well and Anthony looks decent at RB. His receivers will give him a chance every week. Anthony is literally boom or bust, because there is absolutely no knowing how his team will perform week to week. He&#8217;s projected to finish 6-7 but if his players keep popping off, and maybe if Ridley saves some TD&#8217;s for Julio, Anthony could very well make the playoffs. He currently has a 30% chance.</p>

<p>I have no negative things to say about Oron. He&#8217;s a homie, he&#8217;s nice, he hates Warren, what more can you ask for. Fantasy-wise he&#8217;s 1 game under .500 after his loss to Ian, but this back and forth affair, should still get him into the playoffs. Oron has pretty good depth at every position.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-4" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-4" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>Oron has a very well rounded team. Elliott, Hyde, Marvin and Keenan Allen along with Wentz at QB. Oron will make the playoffs in my mind, but his team has been fairly predictable so far. Playing to their projected rankings, not too far high or too low. Elliott has some good games coming up, Carlos Hyde looks like an RB1 and Carson Wentz is almost back to full health. Oron did a good job drafting being a first year, and putting together a very well balanced team (<em>cough</em> Anthony).</p>

<p>Oron traded Royce for Wentz, giving him a starting caliber QB. Great move. His weakest potential spot has been fixed via trade early in the season. Maybe we see Devante Parker play a game and he can be worth his high draft pick. Oron will always be a challenge to beat. If your team has a great game you can beat Oron, but if any player performs under projection, Oron will beat you. As of now Oron looks to have an even 50% shot at making the playoffs.</p>

<p>Jaiden&#8217;s stacked. Fournette (broken hammy boi). Yeldon. Kamara. Davante Adams. A fantasy functional Sammy Watkins (thanks Mahomes), who hasn&#8217;t existed since his rookie year. And Isaiah Fucking Crowell. Jaiden in my mind is potentially a playoff lock. His team died last week, but no one was beating Anthony last week. Aside from that hiccup he&#8217;s pretty much tied for the top PF. Fournette is out, but Jaiden does have Yeldon though so he hasn&#8217;t faced any repercussions.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-5" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>Jaiden&#8217;s going to make noise come January. Kamara&#8217;s numbers should settle down considering that Ingram is back, but he&#8217;s no doubt a top 5 Rb still. Kamara has been amazing this year, so far without Ingram. Although I do have doubts on how he plays with Ingram, but we&#8217;ll see how that plays out. His usage rate is insane, dare I say &#8230; unsaistanable?? Fournette hasn&#8217;t been healthy yet at all so we haven&#8217;t seen much from him, but Yeldon has more than made up for his loss. Davante Adams is a fringe WR1. Aaron Rodgers loves him, and anyone who Rodgers loves, you roster in fantasy. Even if their name is Equanimeous St. Brown or Marquez Valdes-Scantling. Who tf came up with those names lol.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-moves-made-5" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#moves-made-5" aria-hidden="true"></a>Moves Made</h3>
<p>I think Jaiden has the fleecing of the year potentially. TJ Yeldon for Jamison Crowder who is happily sitting on the waiver wire right now. Im not sure why Ian did this trade, Yeldon has value with Fournette in, and given his injury history I would have 100% held onto him. Jaiden makes up for Fournette, and that trade may have saved his year, as his 2nd pick in the draft could&#8217;ve been a dud. Fournette should be back at some point tho, not like it matters for Jaiden. Jaiden is projected 7-6 with a ceiling of a 10-3 season. I think he gets to the ceiling. Big questions for Jaiden are how is Kamara going to perform. Kamara has been keeping Jaiden more than afloat, but again, Ingram is back, and Ingram is good, and Ingram, most importantly has fresh legs.</p>

Cooper Kupp and Juju are absolutely blooming. Both 2nd year WR&#8217;s are playing out of their mind right now. Kupp had a concussion, but he should be back next week and Juju has been dancing in the end zone all year. He has Amari Cooper, who I&#8217;m not sure why he&#8217;s starting. Amari is the only ? mark on his team, and if he gets looks, he plays well. Derek Carr has tunnel vision (the bad kind unlike Kirk Cousins) and he absolutely refuses to throw it down the field to Cooper. God forbid a ball does come to Cooper, there is a very good chance he&#8217;s gonna drop it. Stay away from Cooper, start your other Bama Boi, Ridley.</p>

<p>Mike let go of Brieda and Cole for Calvin Ridley and Juju and I think it was a pretty big win for Mike. Juju and Ridleys numbers aren&#8217;t sustainable at all but they&#8217;re still the number 2 receivers respecitvely. Juju is a little bit more sustainable than Ridley, however. Given Atlanta does have a drunk mind at the helm of their play-calling, Ridley&#8217;s skill should still outclass his idiotic OC&#8217;s play calls.</p>
<p>Mike is projected to go 7-6 and Fantasy pros really likes him giving an upper prediction of 11-2 with an 80% chance to make the playoffs. Wow, great bounce back from Mike this year.</p>

<p>Reece oh Reece. Reece has a 6th sense of trading away players right before they get injured. Guess what, he traded away Jay Ajayi, who was his first RB drafted, and Ajayi has just torn his ACL.

<p>Reece has Ingram back, and he&#8217;s gonna slot in at his RB1. AP, Derrick Henry, and RB 1 BUCK ALLEN are his RB&#8217;s. He has a bunch of decent RB&#8217;s and Ingram. At WR Odell was a pretty good deal for Reece. He also has De Andre fucking Hopkins. And man is Hopkins going off. If Reece makes noise in January, Watson has to stay healthy (yay), but man oh man is Hopkins playing well. Reece did have Adam Thielen and T.Y. Hilton, but Odell is due for more touches. If he doesn&#8217;t get them hell just go do another interview on ESPN.</p>
<p>Now this is probably a hot take, but I&#8217;m gonna give it any way. Mark Ingram. This man is being severely undervalued. People forget how well he did last year and is now an after thought. At the time Im writing this Ingram hasn&#8217;t been played yet, but Im gonna put money on the fact that he&#8217;ll outscore Kamara (need this to happen to get W in other league, so let me believe). Ingram was the goal line back last year. Kamara is the pass catching back. Im not saying Kamara isn&#8217;t going to outscore Ingram rest of the season, but its fair to expect a 60-40 or maybe even a 55-45% target share favoring Kamara. Reece has a steal here and he should ride him to the end, true to his value (<em>cough Enunwa</em>).</p>

<p>Edit: Bam, on point. Go Ingram (have him in another league, and he just won me the game.) Damn Jaiden, imagine drafting Ingrams&#8217;s handcuff as your first pick. Jokes. Should be fun to see how it all works out.</p>

Thielen and Hilton are good, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but Reece has definetly upgraded. Reece is a trade maestro, and if trends continue like they did last year. Reece will be playing games when they matter in January. Albeit with a completely different team than he drafted.</p>
<p>Reece is projected to go 7-6 with an upper record of 9-4. I see Reece with 8 wins, and 4 losses. He should&#8217;ve lost to me but he drugged me and made me start Watson. Funny how this continues to happen.</p>

<p>The newcomer this year, yet not new to football at all. We all know Chris as the biggest Johnny Manziel fan known to date. Chris is also a Rams fan, which frankly I still don&#8217;t understand considering he&#8217;s from Florida. But okay&#8230;His fantasy team though&#8230; to be honest this is the one team I&#8217;m not sure how to fully assess. Chris could very well win the league, or he could dud out. This week wasn&#8217;t good for him, granted that Evans and essentially Cooks were on Bye weeks.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-8" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-8" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>Chris took Dalvin Cook and Kareem Hunt as his RB&#8217;s and those looked like solid picks at the time. Hunt has been playing very well, even in that pass heavy KC offense. Cook though, after having a great couple of games early last year, he also has joined Leonard Fournette on the broke hammy bois crew, and not getting as many starts as he should. Chris does have Matt Breida, who I like but Brieda is also made out of glass. If healthy, Chris can win the league, as he is stacked at WR and RB. If health is not on his side, Chris could miss out on the playoffs.</p>

<p>Chris traded Ridley and Juju for Brieda and Cole. I think Mike came out on the better end of this trade as Juju has been absolutely balling out. Still Cole has a lot of potential and could pop for 15+ any week given Blake Bortles can throw a spiral (and/or) not off his linemen&#8217;s head..</p>

<p>Fantasy Pros has Chris Finishing 7-6 as projected and 8-5 as upper limit. I agree, but I still do think we&#8217;ll see Chris in the playoffs. His team could go off like they did last week vs me putting up 146 points.</p>

<p>He is sooo good. Barkley has given Ian a very sturdy RB to build around, which you absolutely must have if you want to win a fantasy Championship. Barkley continues to be almost a 20 ppg player. If Ian can get a little more depth, I think he could easily take it all. Im looking at Aaron Jones or Kerryon to breakout, if Ian has a shot to win it.

<p>Ian is projected to finish 7-6 with an upper record limit of 9-4. He should make the playoffs with ease, assuming his team stays healthy, which it hasn&#8217;t really done this year. Saquon was banged up at the end of the game last week too so its going to be something to watch. Let&#8217;s see what depth RB&#8217;s Ian pulls out next week.</p>

<p>James Land aka Mr.Commish, also the guy who put 81$ for a guy who has yet to play a snap. &#8220;But Sidd&#8230;I got James Conner&#8230;&#8221;&#8230;shut nerd. Sorry had to get you back for that one.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-10" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ll be honest, I looked at James&#8217;s team right after the draft, and I did not think he would have a good season&#8230;like at all. I didn&#8217;t like what I saw at all. James thankfully picked up James Conner, and that gave his Le&#8217;Veon pick a lot of security.</p>
<p>Conner is no Bell, let&#8217;s get that straight, but when fed the ball he has shown to produce, putting up 2 30+ point games this year, tied with Kamara and Gurley as the only other RB&#8217;s to do that this fall. That&#8217;s some elite company. The time is running out on Conner, but James doesn&#8217;t have anything to worry about considering he has Bell.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s say Bell gets traded. Now we&#8217;re essentially cloning talent. Conner replaces Bell and James gets Le&#8217;Veon&#8217;s numbers still. That&#8217;s the absolute best case for James, and considering Ajayi just went out, I don&#8217;t think James would be too mad if Bell went to the Eagles. Even if he is a Cowboys fan.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-moves-made-10" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#moves-made-10" aria-hidden="true"></a>Moves Made</h3>
<p>James has had no need to make any trades. His team is rounded out well, but after starting 3-0, he has struggled a bit last 2 weeks, albeit due to bad matchups. Brees is playing out of his mind and Landry is getting his targets. Kelce is being Kelce, and hot take #2 here, I believe he&#8217;s the best Tight end in the NFL. Much like Ian, James is well rounded at each position. Regardless of how the Bell situations works out, James will get better once Bell is back. To what degree depends on what the Steelers decide to do. If Bell is traded James is the instant favorite to win the league.</p>
<p>Fantasy pros has James finishing between 7-6 and 8-5. I can see him going around there as well.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-sidds-team-outlook" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#sidds-team-outlook" aria-hidden="true"></a>Sidd&#8217;s team Outlook</h2>
<p>Wow, I finally get to do my writeup? Let&#8217;s be honest last year was pretty much luck for me. Somehow I finished 10-3 last year, but I was never truly happy with my roster. I lacked big name talent and if it wasn&#8217;t for a massive fleecing of Warren in a trade that ended me up with Mark Ingram and Zeke for AJ Green and Orleans Darkwa (lol).</p>
<p>You need big name talent to win, I think I did that this year.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-analysis-11" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#analysis-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>Analysis</h3>
<p>A lot of people tell me, I just copied Thomas from last year, and to an extend I did. Gurley should&#8217;ve been obvious. Im surprised more people didn&#8217;t bid me up for him. Gordon though, I was high on Gordon (L -oh -L) for so long. Melvin Gordon has increased in efficiency every year he played ever since college. His numbers keep getting better. The previous year is always Gordon&#8217;s floor. Melvin was my X-Factor and I think he&#8217;ll do very well. Ekeler is a great handcuff. Funchess is a good projection receiver. Maybe Antonio Droppaway and Mike Williams can appear in my roster at some point as well. Overall I&#8217;m very satasfied with my roster and don&#8217;t feel like I need to make any moves and panic trade anyone yet.</p>
<h3><a id="user-content-moves-made-11" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#moves-made-11" aria-hidden="true"></a>Moves Made</h3>
<p>I traded for Woods, thank you Thomas, you addressed my biggest weakness and gave me a WR1. Hopefully Woods can continue this production. Mahomes has been excellent for me, and if I made the right starts I could&#8217;ve been 5-0. A lot of people doubt my WR Depth, but my other Gordon will finally get a start this week. Yup Josh Gordon will be in my fantasy lineup.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not gonna toot my horn but I feel like I have a good shot to win the league barring injuries, and barring my retardation when starting players. I&#8217;m riding that Mahomes wave to the end.</p>
<p>Fantasy Pros has me ranked as the Top seed with a 7-6 floor and a whopping 11-2 Ceiling. I don&#8217;t think i&#8217;ll make that, but If Gordon, Gurley, Gordon, Mahomes/Watson and Woods keep producing, who the hell knows.</p>
<p>Wow this writeup is long as fuck. Holy shit. Let&#8217;s do the rest of the superlatives, that James usually does.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-top-team" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#top-team" aria-hidden="true"></a>Top Team:</h2>
<p>Jaiden put up 133 making him the top team. Followed by Anthony at 128 and me at 124. Jaiden continues his dominance.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry Dame, but I beat you. Long overdue. But Finally. Demons have been Exorcised. Dame would have beaten 8/11 teams this week. Anyone but me Jaiden and Anthony. Sowwie Dame. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f641.png" alt="🙁" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>I&#8217;m sorry Justin, you started the wrong QB, again. No combination of players gets you a win against Anthony this week. Justin should(and needs to) turn it around next week.</p>
<h2><a id="user-content-weekly-challenge-idk-yet-dame-send-it-bro" class="anchor" href="https://github.com/siddharthsharma94/writeups/blob/master/README.md#weekly-challenge-idk-yet-dame-send-it-bro" aria-hidden="true"></a>Weekly Challenge: The Shoot Yourself in the Foot Award!</h2>
<p>James here, stepping in to write this blurb for Sidd. This award goes to the owner with the largest differential between a bench player that they could have started, and the position that they could have started them in! This goes to Thomas, who won it with either of his running backs that he started, and Kenyan Drake! You know, because everybody expected Kenyan Drake to score 21, and Freeman/Lynch to score 5! Nice work, Thomas.</p>
<p>Alright guys thanks for reading this wall of text. Sorry If I said mean things about your team. Sorry about the grammar fuck ups. And sorry Im gonna beat you all this year in the championship. Gnite.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Note: I procrastinated on this writeup, so it&#8217;s going to lack the usual pictures and videos which accompany writeups.</p>
<p>So it’s OU-Texas week, which means that I should probably talk about college football. I haven’t done that yet this season, mainly because I honestly haven’t watched all that much college football. Sure, I’ve been keeping up with the OU games, and I’ve been paying attention to the Big 12, but I have a very limited idea of what’s going on elsewhere. Basically, I’m making excuses for why this writeup is going to suck, and all the info in it is going to be incorrect. Anyways, here’s some things that I do know.</p>
<p>FACT: OU has won all five of their games so far this season, and is undefeated going into the OU-Texas game. We haven’t yet had the game where we mysteriously lose to an opponent who is far inferior to us. Hopefully it’s not this weekend.</p>
<p>FACT: Kyler Murray had 7 touchdowns last week, tying Baker Mayfield’s single game record which he set vs. Texas Tech, who was quarterbacked by Patrick Mahomes at the time, who is currently quarterbacking the Kansas City Chiefs, who I am currently watching right now on Monday Night Football.</p>
<p>FACT: Texas lost to Kansas in 2016 in football.</p>
<p>OPINION: I can’t take it anymore. Jason Witten is just a terrible commentator. I hate listening to him try to do analysis. It’s tearing my soul apart. I mean, I kinda get what he’s trying to say, ­<em>most</em> of the time. But he just does not say it very well with the mics turned on. Y’know, CBS got really lucky to hire Tony Romo to do their play-by-play. It’s impressive how good he is, both in front of the camera and in his analysis. I learn so much listening to Tony talk about football. Witten, however, sounds like the kid from the “boom goes the dynamite” video. He just sounds stressed the whole time.</p>
<p>FACT: That last paragraph was not about college football.</p>
<p>OPINION: This Alabama team might be the best Alabama team that Nick Saban has ever had. Usually, with an Alabama squad, you could always count on the fact that their quarterback play was solid, but not elite. Usually the Tide would roll with <em>The Drive</em><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; run, run, run, play action pass, relying on the strength of their backs to wear down the opponent over the course of the game. Backs like Mark Ingram, Eddie Lacy, T.J. Yeldon, Derrick Henry, and Jalen Hurts. Maybe not so much recently – their offensive coordinators have installed some different packages over the years, but they’ve never had a truly elite QB, in my opinion. This year might be different – their QB, Tua, is in the Heisman conversation, and has been outstanding. Maybe I’ll watch a Bama game, once they get a good ranked matchup. Maybe vs. LSU.</p>
<p>FACT: Texas lost to Maryland in 2018. Maryland would go on to lose to Temple by three scores.</p>
<p>FACT: I have no idea what’s happening in the Pac 12 right now. I think Stanford is good? But they lost to Notre Dame? USC lost to Texas, we beat UCLA (who is currently winless). Washington lost to Auburn, but maybe they’re good otherwise. Ah, looks like Colorado is undefeated, but they don’t have a signature win yet. I don’t know who the hell is going to win the Pac 12.</p>
<p>FACT: I have a marginally better picture of the ACC. Florida State looks bad, but somehow beat Louisville I think. Syracuse seems pretty good, and gave Clemson a run for its money. Clemson will probably win the conference again, but apparently has a quarterback controversy?</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I’ll admit, it took me some time to get up to speed on Clemson’s QB situation. I was really confused as to who the current and past quarterbacks are and aren’t. At one point I thought that Travis Etienne was a quarterback after seeing an ESPN headline which read “Etienne rallies No. 3 Clemson to 27-23 win over Orange”. This made me question why I’m even doing this write up on college football which I have not been following closely this year. Anyways, here’s the rundown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kelly Bryant, the Clemson QB from last year, played some for the early games.</li>
<li>In the Texas A&amp;M game (Oron/Justin may have known this already), Clemson brought in their hotshot freshman QB, and highly ranked recruit, Trevor Lawrence. After this game, they named Trevor Lawrence starting QB, and Kelly Bryant announces his intent to transfer.</li>
<li>In the Syracuse game, Lawrence was knocked out of the game with a bad looking hit to the head, which caused a neck injury. Chase Brice, the third string, played QB for the rest of the game. Travis Etienne, the running back, scored three touchdowns in that game, one in the wildcat.</li>
<li>Hunter Renfrow, the receiver who caught the final touchdown in the Bama/Clemson natty in 2017, is apparently splitting reps at QB/WR this week.</li>
</ul>
<p>OPINION: Clemson is in trouble.</p>
<p>FACT: Texas lost to OU last year. I was at the game. It was fun.</p>
<p>FACT: I haven’t talked about the Big 10 yet. I watched some of the OSU/PSU game last weekend, and the Buk pulled it out, somehow. I assumed that when Penn State went up 26-14, the game was over, so I went back over to play Secret Hitler. I should have kept watching – the buk came bak to score another two touchdowns late. Man, you can never count good teams out, can you?</p>
<p>FACT: You guys are definitely annoyed at me and this terrible format, so I’ll stop writing. For my OU-Texas prediction, I’m guessing we’ll have a high-scoring affair, because I doubt our defense will be able to stop much of anything, and I’m expecting our offense to be clicking. I’ll call it 35-31 OU over Texas in a nailbiter.</p>
<p><strong>Top Team</strong></p>
<p>The clouds parted, and the sun shone down upon the chosen champion, who decided not to start an injured tight end this week and somehow put up one hundred and fifty nine point seven points, the highest scoring single-game point total so far this season, and upsetting the once undefeated Jaiden Gerig. The individual of whom I speak is none other than Anthony! This box score mystifies me. I think the thing that jumps out the most is James White, who Tony drafted for a fucking dollar because he couldn’t get anybody else, and is now somehow RB7 through four games. Call me crazy, but Tony might be a legit contender, running the 0 rb strategy. All of his top tier receivers produced this week, and have produced so far this season (but then we never really expected any of them to bust). Both James White and Phillip Lindsay are good backs. Eric Ebron, who was just sitting on waivers for some reason, has only had one game in which he has not produced double digit numbers. This is kind of insane.</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scoring Loser</strong></p>
<p>Sidd’s team was fantastic this week, with its best showing yet. Great performances from Gurley and Gordon as per usual, a fantastic performance by Kittle, who is now TE3, another good showing from Patrick Mahomes, and a solid game from Robert Woods all contributed to his 140.9 point week. Unfortunately, he had to go up against Chris’s team this week, who was just slightly better. 31 from Cousins vs. the Rams on Thursday night, 25 from Kareem Hunt (his best showing so far this season), 22 from Cooks, 19 from John Brown, and 12 from Eifert before he shattered his leg. Tough break, but I don’t feel sorry for the guy currently getting 60 points worth of production from his RBs right now.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest Scoring Winner</strong></p>
<p>After this week, no team was winless. Congrats to the Katz for claiming his first victory this week, edging Thomas by a score of 93.8-85.1! It wasn’t easy – Katz had to rely on a solid performance from the TE1, Jared Cook, as well as good games from Brady and T.Y. Hilton (at least before the injury), but all that matters is that notch in the win column. Good game, Justin!</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel</strong></p>
<p>Rough day for Thomas. Nine points from Russell Wilson, five from Miller, and 0 from O.J. Howard, who was removed from the game due to an MCL sprain. Thomas’s team looks like a massacre. Freeman has been out for a few weeks now, Chris Carson was out after an injury, O.J. Howard (mentioned previously), and Kenyan Drake has been especially underwhelming the last two weeks. There are some bright spots, however – Lynch looked great vs Cleveland this past weekend, Tyreek Hill always has the potential to go off, and Diggs is a threat on the outside. Also, Corey Davis looked good vs Philly this past weekend, and faces the Bills this week.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player</strong></p>
<p>It’s fucking Kamara again. Jesus Christ his numbers are insane this year. He’s had two 38 point weeks, including this past week. TWO! This was the first week that he was able to really rack up the rushing numbers, which would be good news for Jaiden, considering that this week’s weekly challenge was for rushing yards. Unfortunately, Kamara finished 2<sup>nd</sup> this week. Also unfortunately, Jaiden lost this week. Sorry to kick you while you’re down. But hey, you’ve got the best player in fantasy!</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start</strong></p>
<p>Found the negative points, it’s Damian, back with another bad defense! This week, it’s the Browns D, although you can’t blame him for trying them. They’ve been averaging a little over 10 points per week, until this week. Unfortunately, when you turn the ball over in the red zone three times, you’re gonna have problems avoiding getting scored on. You can put the blame on B… Buh… uh, nobody. Wasn’t anyone’s fault. Nope. Browns defense just sucks. Sorry. Browns won that game, too. Miraculously. Yup.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench</strong></p>
<p>So, apparently Tarik Cohen is a thing, now? Not sure why he got worked into the gameplan so much this week, but he had a massive fantasy score, putting up 26.9. Wouldn’t have won me the game, but if I had started him, it would have at least been closer. Still, that’s a lot of points to just leave on my bench, so I’m gonna give it to me this week.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge</strong></p>
<p>Did you know that Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott leads the NFL in rushing yards so far this season? He has a total of 426 yards on 73 carries, averaging 5.8 yards per carry! And this past weekend, he ran for 152 yards on 25 attempts, winning Oron the weekly challenge! What was it called again? The Samaje “Adrian “AD” Peterson” Perine Running Back award? I don’t fucking remember.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ladies and gentlenerds.</p>
<p>The Browns won a game.</p>
<p>Go ahead, rub your eyes in disbelief. You read that correctly.</p>
<p>The Cleveland Browns. The worst team the modern NFL has ever seen. Won. A. Game.</p>
<p>19 games. Your team might get obliterated by the Buffalo Bills. Your team might lose the NFC Championship in heartbreaking fashion. Your team might be cursed with awful placekicking when it matters the most (or maybe that’s all just my team). But, in all likelihood, you’ll never see your team fail to win 19 consecutive games. But Browns fans did just that. And they deserve to enjoy that dub.</p>
<p>More important to you nerds, who aren’t Browns fans, is the manner in which they won that first game in two years. Backup quarterback, Baker Mayfield—the number one overall draft pick by the Browns—heralded as the hopeful savior of Cleveland, got his first real taste of NFL action, and my god, was it a good one. Baker marched down the field, repeatedly, to a tune of 17 for 23, and led the Browns in a heroic second half comeback to take the W from Sam Darnold’s New York Jets. Don’t know what’s in the rookie QBs water, but I want some of it.</p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" src="https://streamable.com/s/7u9pe/mpxqqv" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t know what’s in store for Baker. He was fantastic in college, and he was—in my pleb opinion—the best QB coming into the NFL this season. One game, no matter how excellent it was, is not nearly enough to crown him as “for real.”</p>
<p>That being said, the hype RV has officially left the parking lot. And we’re all aboard for the ride.</p>
<p>Is this where I’m supposed to say “Boomer Sooner?” I’m not good at this whole James thing.</p>
<p>With that, let’s recap this week’s fantasy matchups, starting with mine.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Best Friend Bowl</u></strong></p>
<p>Reece v. Dame 2. Last year’s week 3 marquee matchup, where Reece completely blew me out, 109.6 to 73.6. This year’s week 3 marquee matchup….where Reece completely blew me out, 116 to 82.6. Two years, two 30 point Ls. Reece got a <em>ton</em> of help from his new players, Sanders and Beckham, who combined for 30 points. Sanders had a 35 yard rushing touchdown, which completely deflated me, and Beckham turned around from a horribly mediocre performance against the Boys to thrash the Houston D. I’m blaming Ian; if Reece had Ajayi and Thielen still, I <em>totally</em> would’ve won. Or at least could have. But probably not. Not with how well Reece’s team as a whole performed. I roasted Reece at the draft saying he’d be 0-4 without Ingram. Turns out, I’m wrong. Again.</p>
<p>On the bright side—for me—McCaffrey is beyond <strong><em>legit</em></strong>. This is two weeks in a row where he puts up 20 points without a touchdown in either, which is nuts. One week of 100+ yards through the air, another of 180+ yards on the ground. Looks like the entire Panthers offense runs through McCaffrey, and once those tuddys start coming, you’re all absolutely fucked. The rest of my team may have underperformed—looking at you, Dan Bailey and the Vikings offense—but McCaffrey is looking to be a bona fide RB1. Sure am glad he’s in my starting lineup this week against Ian!</p>
<p><em>Wait,<strong> who’s </strong>on bye?</em></p>
<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.250%;"><iframe style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" src="https://streamable.com/s/za9ih/guosnu" width="100%" height="100%" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></div>
<div></div>
<p><strong><u>Fournette Who?</u></strong></p>
<p>Under no circumstances did I think Jaiden would be this good. He had a great team at the draft for sure, but Jaiden leading the league? It’d definitely be someone more experienced, like me, or Chris, or Thomas. However, dumbass Dame reveals himself again, as Jaiden is completely steamrolling everyone in the league, and we’re all powerless to stop it. Alvin Kamara got <em>twenty targets</em>, reeling in 15 for catches. Remember how just above I was getting off to CMC putting up 20 points without a TD? Kamara put up <em>26 </em>without a touchdown. I want off Mr. Tennessee’s Wild Ride, but I can absolutely see why Jaiden wouldn’t. Also, I think Crowell exceeding his entire last year’s point total just this week, which is absurd. And there was also that Vance McDonald play that got our favorite rapist another tuddy on the board. Who needs Fournette when everyone else is a superstar?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Justin is not looking hot through 3 weeks. Sorry, bud. Michael Thomas is putting up league records—did you know that he has the most receptions through 3 games in NFL history?—but Justin’s RB corps is absolutely abysmal. 4.3 from Duke Johnson, who is his number 2—maybe 1—RB right now. You may need to make a trade, my friend. Tell ya what, I’ll give you Peyton Barber for Michael Thomas, who says no?</p>
<p><strong><u>Boomers vs. Sooners</u></strong></p>
<p>We have the Oklahoma Bowl here this week, as reigning champion Thomas Huerta takes on reigning title belt holder James Land. Based on this outcome matchup, James continues to be the reigning Chad from Oklahoma, while Thomas is very much the virgin. I take some of the blame; Thomas asked me how confident I was in Diggs/Murray this week, and I told him “100% would fire them both up with no regrets, wouldn’t be surprised to see each put up 25.” Well, I was wrong, and the Vikings sucked. 2/9 of Thomas’s offense went out the window along with the Vikings, and there was no salvaging that. Sorry about that, bud.</p>
<p>James, meanwhile, was the biggest beneficiary of the Saints/Falcons shootout today. 20 points? That’s nothing to Brees. 30? Still a joke. How about 40? That’s more up Breesus’s alley. Landry proving to be a low-end WR1 at worst—which James has given me much deserved shit for doubting—and the Kansas City offense showing that they’re done “running through one player” like they did last year. Hunt game/Hill game/Kelce game? Gone are those days. Now everyone feasts. All hail Pat Mahomes, our one true God.</p>
<p><strong><u>Battle of the Badgers</u></strong></p>
<p>0-2 waiver “champion” Tony Cudz takes on Mike “Mike” Fortman this week in the Badger Bowl. Tony’s probably wishing he didn’t drop Matt Ryan now, who would’ve catapulted his team into a victory this week. Tony’s RBs were not too bad this week; 12.7 points out of Morris—with a ton of upside if Breida is hurt—is looking good, and his receivers showed up as best they could. Tony’s starters were lacking in the tuddy department, which kept him from getting the dub this week. Slowly but surely he’s coming around, but Big Ton’ might need to make some moves to get a better RB at this rate. Ton of WR talent on the bench he can’t start, not a lot in the backfield.</p>
<p>Mike’s team, meanwhile, hasn’t lost a step without Mixon. Gio Bernard stepped in and did exactly what he needed to do; Alex Collins got the goal-line carries—which 11 of the 12 members of the league thought would happen—but Amari Cooper went back to being, well, Amari Cooper. Xavien Howard looks to be a legitimate top 5 corner, so I can’t say I’m surprised. Fins Up, baby. Mike’s looking up from here on out, sitting at 2-1 with Calvin Ridley on his bench and a team with no clear weakness.</p>
<p><strong><u>Upset Alert!</u></strong></p>
<p>Title is self-explanatory. #1 in points forced, one of the few undefeated teams left, facing an 0-2-and-also-almost-last-in-points-forced Oron, whoda thunk that Chris would fall now? Well, who thought the Bills would beat the Vikings? Nobody, that’s who.</p>
<p>Chris and Thomas both suffered from Vikings-itis this week, as the awful performance by Minnesota completely tanked his chances this week, too. 10 points from your QB is not going to get it done without a stellar performance from your skill players, and Chris, unfortunately, didn’t get that. Kareem Hunt put up 2 tuddys, but even that wasn’t enough to get him into the top RBs this week. Engram and Cole disappointed, relative to their expectations this week, and Fat Randy did Fat Randy things. Namely, not good things. Don’t worry bud, I took the Dan Bailey donut for you. Thank me later.</p>
<p>Oron, on the other hand, showed why he targeted the players that he did. Carlos Hyde’s usage has been out of this world, and he was bound to feast. Well, he did. Royce Freeman once again got goal line carries, showing everyone about how washed he is and how “pHiLiP lInDsAy Is GoNnA oWn ThAt BaCkFiElD.” I know Lindsay got ejected, but still, shut nerd. Fitzmagic went full Fitztragic <em>and back to Fitzmagic</em>, and with the loss of Jimmy G, I see Oron riding this bearded beauty until the wheels fall off. And they will. I just wonder how many wins Oron is going to rack up before then.</p>

<div></div>
<p><strong><u>Super Sharma</u></strong></p>
<p>Can Sidd be stopped? For the third week, Sidd is in the upper echelon in scoring, and this time he actually got the benefit of the GOAT, Pat Mahomes. Speaking of who, I’m going to spend the next paragraph expressing my inner feelings for Pat Mahomes.</p>
<p>Pat Mahomes can slang it like a motherfucker. Pat Mahomes holds the NCAA record in single-game passing yards, but he also holds the NFL record for biggest balls. I don’t know how Pat Mahomes can throw the ball as well as he does with his balls being that gigantic. Did you see that rollout TD? If I could marry a touchdown pass, that would be the one I pick. Three games, 13 tuddys, no picks. Watson last year was just the appetizer; Pat Mahomes is the main entrée. Sidd doesn’t need receivers. Sidd has God.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and then there’s Ian. Ian’s team has been great all season (minus last week), but this week he unfortunately ran into the Sidd buzzsaw. Ian totaled the 4<sup>th</sup> highest scoring output this week, led by the thiccest boi in the league, Saquon Barkley. Will Fuller might actually be the real deal; Adam Thielen did Adam Thielen things (namely, feast); and Jordan Howard’s usage is only somewhat concerning! Don’t be surprised if we see Ian in the playoffs. His team is legit.</p>
<p>With all of these words out of the way, let’s get into the good stuff: our Weekly Superlatives.</p>
<p><strong>Top Team</strong></p>
<p>Sidd, with the world’s greatest quarterback at the helm, led his team to an astoundi-….</p>
<p>…wait, Sidd didn’t get Top Player? Who did?</p>
<p><em>Oh dear god.</em></p>
<p>Jaiden, with a whopping 140.9, takes the top team title this week. Not a single hole on Jaiden’s team this week—every single player but Njoku put up double digits—including a perfectly normal 26.5 from Kamara and 24 from the league’s #1 alleged rapist. Round and round the schedule goes, who can stop Jaiden? Hell if I know.</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scoring Loser</strong></p>
<p>Goes to the one and only Ian Kwan. Ian had a rough week last week, but rebounded in a fantastic way, managing to have the 4<sup>th</sup> most points forced this week! Unfortunately, the luck of the draw had him matched up against Sidd, and not even the 4<sup>th</sup> most was enough to save his record. This blurb is usually used to roast owners for bad decisions, but there was nothing that Ian could do this week. Things just weren’t meant to be. Much like me having thighs like Saquon.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest Scoring Winner</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Fortman. Wisconsin’s favorite son. Sorry Tony, you lost that title this week along with the game. Mike’s 92 would’ve only beaten 4 teams this week, and he got lucky that he was matched up against one of ‘em. Amari is, once again, a total bum. Chris Thompson got game-scripted out. Doesn’t matter; still won. Please file all complaints to the number 2 in the win column.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel</strong></p>
<p>Justin friggin’ Katz. So at the end of the draft, we all unanimously agreed that Tony had the worst team, right?</p>
<p>Well, we were wrong. Sorry bud. Tony has 3 elite receivers and no RBs; you, my friend, only have two, and even worse RBs. Justin, thanks to Shady’s ribs, had to start a backfield combination of Duke Johnson and LeGarrette Blount. If you gagged reading that, I understand completely. Brady also completely fell off the wagon this week, leaving our pal Justin in last place, and falling to 0-3. I hope you turn it around, my friend. Fantasy’s more fun when you do.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player</strong></p>
<p>I’m going to give this a two-fer. Top player based on score this week goes to James, who started Drew Brees and won a sweet $5 for it. Remember, kids, this week’s was about “highest scoring QB.” Really, top player in my mind is “player who most surpassed expectations,” which would go to Mike and his benched Calvin Ridley. Holy hell. WR3 on the depth chart and 3 tuddys. If he was on FAAB, someone (re: Sidd) would be spending a ton of money on him right about now.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start</strong></p>
<p>Oh no, it’s me, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Oh wait, thanks Oron. Oron with the Chargers D/ST going against the Rams. -4 from a defense is very much in “not good territory,” especially when almost anyone could tell you that the Rams were going to roll them.</p>
<p>Honorable mention to me for spending $6 on a kicker that didn’t even attempt an XP, let alone a FG. Fuck the Vikings. Why couldn’t I have just been born a shitty Pats fan?</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench</strong></p>
<p>Reece, you knew it was coming. Reece DM’d me before the game talking about how he was going to start Derrick Henry over both Adrian Peterson and Buck Allen, because of some stupid stuff about “zone blocking” and “Alabama.” Well, ya dingus, you benched both RBs who tripled—even quadrupled for AD!&#8211;his output. Especially bad given how hard we all grilled you for spending on Buck Allen. For you to be proven right and not reap the rewards, you gotta get this award.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge Winner</strong></p>
<p>Who came up with this shit? The commish wins again? I call rigged. Crooked James stealing our money right from under our noses.</p>
<p>James wins $5 and the aptly named “Uncle Rico Award” for Drew Brees channeling his inner Patrick Mahomes to will the Saints to an OT victory. Next week, we have the Samaje “Adrian ‘All Day’ Peterson” Perine award: $5 goes to whoever starts the RB with the most yards from scrimmage.</p>
<p>Note, I said yards. Your mediocre pass-catching RB in a stupid John Harbaugh committee that oppresses my high school boi Alex Collins can get 4 tuddys all he wants; we’re caring about yardage this week. Fingers crossed it’s Barber. Or Williams. Whichever one I decide to start. I need anything.</p>
<p>3 weeks in the books, boys. Now we can start to see who the good teams are and who might not be. Still though, the season’s young. No need to overreact. No need to sell your players for trash (unless it’s to me). Everything’s still open season.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. I’ll be back in a couple weeks to write another 2,500 word essay on Fantasy Football.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about this week’s football events, and I’ve come to a very profound conclusion. Football is a cruel sport. Now, I’m not talking about cruel as in the hits that players take on a weekly basis, the long term damage that can be sustained  from the game, or even the insults that players hurl at each other. No, I’m speaking of cruelty to the most important participant in the football experience: the football fan.</p>
<p>Football fans don’t expect much. All we want is to cheer on our own team, or, failing that, to cheer on a worthy underdog, and for a dramatic story to turn into an exciting ending. In the NFL, there are 32 teams. This means that every year, fans of 31 teams feel like the NFL is cruel and unjust. “Why can’t my team win a Super Bowl?” they wonder, as their team loses a game which inevitably ends their run at a championship, whether that be in week 10 or in February. Now, never mind the fact that every team has about as good of a shot as the others to win every year, and can rebuild through the draft, fire and replace coaches who suck, and usually end up with dramatically fluctuating records from season to season. This was our year, dammit, and we were due! Why are the football gods so unjust to MY team?</p>
<div style="width: 525px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-58-4" width="525" height="295" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/lorP90kfUe374yK7T3/giphy.mp4?_=4" /><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/lorP90kfUe374yK7T3/giphy.mp4">https://media.giphy.com/media/lorP90kfUe374yK7T3/giphy.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>College football is cruel. So cruel, that when you get one or two losses, it totally eliminates you from championship contention. It’s cutthroat, take no prisoners football, with every game a moment to say something about whether you’re good enough or not. Sometimes you win, but sometimes you just get your doors blown off by a real contender. Take Alabama vs. Ole Miss this past weekend. Ole Miss, on the very first play, aired it out to D.K Matcalf for a 75 yard touchdown score and gave their fans, and the fans around the world, a little sliver of hope that Alabama was vulnerable. The final score of this game was 62-7 in favor of the Crimson Tide. No, world, Alabama is not vulnerable and is in fact very good, as per usual. Cruelty.</p>
<p>But sometimes, even the small things seem cruel. The Browns were everyone’s favorite punching bag last year, and the year before, and the year before, and… well god dammit, everybody wants to see them succeed this year. Josh Gordon is everyone’s favorite comeback player – a guy who is trying to reestablish himself as a dominant receiver after a few years absence from the NFL due to his problems with addiction. The ultimate Cinderella story would be the Browns winning again, with Josh Gordon leading the charge as their star receiver. Sadly, neither of those things look promising. The Cleveland Browns have still not won a football game since 2016 (ties do NOT count as wins), and after Gordon was late to a practice this past week, have decided to trade the receiver to the New England Patriots, of all teams, for a measly fifth round pick. The Browns remind us once again that they are in football hell, and unless proven otherwise, that is where we believe they will stay.</p>
<p>Yes, football is often very cruel, and the things that you wish would happen often do not. However, when those things do happen – when the stars align, the miracle play is made, the underdog wins the Super Bowl in dramatic fashion – it only makes them that much more special.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player</strong></p>
<p>This week, Chris takes the high score with 140 points! Chris’s team had a fantastic week, as all of his first seven players ended up with double digit scores! Kirk Cousins put up a 33 point day in an overtime game vs Green Bay. Hunt and Cook were solid double-digit backs. Mike Evans was a beneficiary of another week of Fitzmagic, JuJu was the top Steelers receiver, and Cooks balled out vs a hapless Arizona team. Even Evan Engram earned enough points in an otherwise uninspired Giants offensive effort to put him above the fifteen point mark. The only dull spots were the Jaguars D vs. New England and an injured kicker. Hats off to Chris this week!</p>
<p><strong>Highest Scoring Loser</strong></p>
<p>The outcome of this game was exciting, and what a close game it was. With Monday Night Football remaining, the only player left to play was Cody Parkey, the kicker for the Chicago Bears, vs the Seattle Seahawks. All that needed to happen was for the Seahawks to hold the kicker to 4 or fewer points, and Sidd would squeak out the victory. Alas, it was not meant to be for poor Sidd, as Cody Parkey kicked the game-winning extra point early in the fourth quarter, with a follow up kick later on, after the pick six. Games this close always leave the loser questioning every decision ever made in fantasy football. Man, if only I had started any of my bench wideouts over Robby Anderson, or had swapped this quarterback for that quarterback. More on that later on.</p>
<p><strong>Lowest Scoring Winner</strong></p>
<div style="width: 525px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-58-5" width="525" height="295" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/MTsBCHIQrzEddYGKpF/giphy.mp4?_=5" /><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/MTsBCHIQrzEddYGKpF/giphy.mp4">https://media.giphy.com/media/MTsBCHIQrzEddYGKpF/giphy.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Going back to that Monday Night Football game, I was sure that I was cooked, after Seattle scored in the fourth quarter to make it 17-10. At that point, I was at a two point deficit to Justin, and I figured the difference would only grow from there. I started working on the main section of the write-up, talking about how football could be so cruel, and so on. By the way, in case you haven’t been paying attention, I’m not good at losing. I can be very competitive, even for the most trivial things. So when Prince Amukamara knew what play Russell Wilson was going to run out of the empty set, and stepped in front of his pass, and housed it, I got reaaaaally excited. Even though it’s just one fantasy football game, and even though I didn’t really care whether the Bears or the Seahawks actually won that game, I went nuts. I would have lost to six of the teams this week.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel</strong></p>
<p>The thing that surprises me most about Mike’s team this week is how low Aaron Rodgers’s score is. Kirk Cousins scored over 30, and these two played in the same overtime game! Yeah, I guess he was nursing his knee injury that he got <em>carted off the field for</em> last week, but his yardage total isn’t that much lower than last week’s. He did only have one passing touchdown though, as opposed to Cousins with four. That’ll do it. The other thing was how well Jacksonville did in shutting down Rob Gronkowski. I remember watching that game, and Tony (Romo) mentioning how well Jacksonville was defending Gronk, and how many different ways they were doing it. I think at one point they sent a safety over to cover him near the sideline, and dropped their linebacker, Myles Jack, back into the safety position in cover 1, which was nuts to me. Anyways, Mike will look to bounce back this week vs. Tony (Cudz).</p>
<p><strong>Top Player</strong></p>
<p>There were a LOT of quarterback points in the KC vs. Pittsburgh shootout. Even though Mahomes had more touchdowns, Big Ben ended up with more points, on account of his rushing score. Remember kids: rushing is more important than passing. At least for your quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start</strong></p>
<div style="width: 525px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-58-6" width="525" height="295" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3iCp9N7etV5BbzSjaH/giphy.mp4?_=6" /><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3iCp9N7etV5BbzSjaH/giphy.mp4">https://media.giphy.com/media/3iCp9N7etV5BbzSjaH/giphy.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>We had a pair of bad defenses this week. Cincinnati put the hurt on the Ravens on Thursday Night Football, after A.J. Green’s explosive, Will-Fuller-like performance in the first half and no redeeming points thereafter (not even a single sack). On the other side of this matchup, the Panthers were unable to handle Steve Sarkisian’s wit, and allowed 31 points to the Falcons. At least they got a pick out of Matt Ryan!</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench</strong></p>
<p>Sidd, you knew it was coming. Well, here it is. Patrick Mahomes, with all the weapons he has in that Kansas City offense, looks like the young prodigy everybody said he would be. And when you sit him down on the day he throws for SIX TOUCHDOWNS vs. the Pittsburgh Steelers, you have made a big mistake. Now, I know what you’re going to say to me. “But James, Deshaun Watson didn’t have a bad day! It’s tough to make a decision between Mahomes and Watson! I’m a nerd!” Well, I don’t know why you brought up that last thing, but shut for a minute and let me share my opinion. I think it’s safe to say that Patrick Mahomes had a better performance in week one than Deshaun Watson. Patrick Mahomes threw for 256 yards and 4* touchdowns vs the LA Chargers in week one (*at least one of those TDs should be classified as a handoff, but whatever). Deshaun Watson threw for about a buck seventy-five, with a touchdown, an interception, and a lost fumble. At the beginning of the season, I would say that Watson and Mahomes have had about the same experience in the NFL. Maybe give Watson a little more experience in actual games, but they’re both in their second year. Patrick Mahomes has two major weapons in Tyreek Hill and Travis Kelce, while Houston&#8217;s weapons include Hopkins, and sometimes Fuller. Plus, Patrick Mahomes is just really, really talented, with a cannon arm and a quick release. So yeah, I probably would have gone with Mahomes. And you will too, next week.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge Winner</strong></p>
<p>This week’s weekly challenge was the biggest drop off from week one to week two. This includes all bench players. And, well, I won! I dropped off from 180.6 down to 136.3 this week, a difference of 44.3. Thomas was second with a difference of 32.4. Reece rose the most, from 123.9 to 166.8 (+42.9).</p>
<p>Damian has graciously been voluntold to do the write-up for this coming week. Please, give him the same respect that you give me. Because otherwise he won’t do it again, and I need a break every once in a while.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gentlemen and… gentlemen, week one of the 2018 NFL season (and our fantasy football season) has come to a close. And man, am I glad that NFL football is back. It was an entertaining week one, that’s for sure. This week had just about everything, from low-scoring defensive slugfests, to high-octane shootouts, to blowouts, to ties, to rain delays, and to top it all off, another fucking Aaron Rodgers miracle game. So I think for the writeup this week, I’m just gonna talk about the things that excited me about this opening weekend of football played at the very highest of levels, unless you’re watching the Dallas Cowboys offense.</p>
<p>First off, we had that Thursday night game, Eagles v. Falcons. I was mainly just watching this game to pass time waiting for the new Spider-Man game to finally be released at 11:00 pm that evening. (Sidebar, that Spider-Man game is fucking fantastic and if you are even a slight fan of the wall-crawler you should play it, it’s so fun and the story is amazing.) The game kicked off late after a 45 minute rain delay, and the story of that game was how the Falcons seemed to drive the ball decently, but when they got down into the red zone they could just not do a damn thing. Early on they went for it on fourth and goal from the one and got no points. I remember being confused (and somewhat relieved) that Julio came out of the game in the red zone on that first drive. I also loved making fun of Reece for his comments on Ajayi until he actually became the workhorse in the second half.</p>
<div style="width: 525px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-47-10" width="525" height="295" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/SJCmvBZlxsMg8A7J28/giphy.mp4?_=10" /><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/SJCmvBZlxsMg8A7J28/giphy.mp4">https://media.giphy.com/media/SJCmvBZlxsMg8A7J28/giphy.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Sunday morning, I mostly watched the Browns face off vs. their division rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers. I was especially looking forward to this game, not only because the Browns were rumored to be much improved from last year, but also because I got to watch my new RB, the cancer survivor who shares my name, James Conner. And man was he effective. I don’t even remember the name of the running back that I paid $83 dollars for in the draft. Anyways, the Steelers were up 21-7 in the fourth and I thought that the Browns were just about finished, and then Miles Garrett happened. Suddenly, a forced fumble and a Hyde touchdown later, the Browns had a chance. Following that, a late drive and a touchdown from Gordon sent the game to OT. Both teams had opportunities to checkmate, but blunders on both sides forced the two sides to agree to a draw. Er, you know what I mean. A missed field goal by Chris Boswell of the Steelers, and a blocked field goal on the Browns’ game winning attempt by T.J. Watt, eventually led us to a 21-21 draw. So the Browns no longer have a losing streak!</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I watched the Cowboys struggle to do fucking anything vs. the Panthers. Dak and the boys couldn’t get it going on offense. Zeke was mostly stacked up at the line, which is not something I’m used to seeing from our line – they usually can move guys and zone block pretty well. It’s probably the absence of Frederick that’s hurting us there, but Connor Williams, our new left guard that we drafted and were excited about, was struggling as well. In the passing game, we were clueless. There were a couple of third down conversions to Beasley, but that’s about it. No Dez, no Witten, no offense. Dak was never really comfortable, and was missing guys low a few times. But hey, the defense was pretty good. I think we’ll still win some games, but there’s not a lot of talent there on offense for the Cowboys to do what we’ve come to expect from them.</p>
<div style="width: 525px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-47-11" width="525" height="295" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/4NaKWSUHK9sBqsTJX4/giphy.mp4?_=11" /><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/4NaKWSUHK9sBqsTJX4/giphy.mp4">https://media.giphy.com/media/4NaKWSUHK9sBqsTJX4/giphy.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>I heard smatterings about some other games during the day. Ryan Fitzmagic lit the Saints up in the best passing day of his career, which was probably the biggest surprise of the day. The Bills fucking suck – who would have thought that starting a guy who threw 5 picks in a half wouldn’t turn out well? Adrian Peterson is back, or the Cardinals are terrible – probably a little of columns A &amp; B on that one. The Titans and the Dolphins played the longest game in the history of football, because they got delayed for three hours. Finally, the Sunday night game. I watched the second quarter of this game, and assumed that the Bears were going to win, based on a few key details that I uncovered while watching the broadcast.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Bears had a 17-0 lead going into the half.</li>
<li>Khalil Mack was having a monster day, being directly involved in two turnovers</li>
<li>Aaron Rodgers was already carted off with a knee injury.</li>
<li>Deshone Kiser was the backup QB.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on these details, I figured that 2 + 2 = 4 and went back to playing Spider-Man. Turns out, 2 + 2 = fucking 9000 because that’s A-Rod’s power level. Of course he came back, and of course the Packers came back to win at home, because that’s what they do. Hats off to the guy, he’s a miracle-worker.</p>
<p>And now, the week’s superlatives.</p>
<p><strong>Top Team</strong>: Hello everyone. It feels weird to write a blurb about myself for the top team, because I don’t think it ever happened last year. But I hit on just about every player on my team. At QB, Drew Brees was predictably high-scoring vs the Bucs, with the second highest fantasy numbers behind Ryan Fitzmagic. After losing Bell, I quickly and quietly scooped up James Conner off FAAB, and then he put up 30 points. Dion Lewis, after a slow start, took over the Titans backfield after the rain delay and scored a nice 17 points. All of my receivers had solid outings – Fitzgerald got 10 points in a losing effort, Landry found some nice catches late vs the Steelers, and Crabtree got a touchdown vs. the Bills. The Titans D was good vs. the Dolphins, with a couple of picks. The only two players who didn’t really pan out were Kelce and Chris Boswell, who missed a game winning FG, but I can live with that. All-in-all, good week one.</p>
<p><strong>Highest-Scoring Loser: </strong>So I wrote two possible blurbs for this category, because at the time of writing the rest of the writeup yesterday (Monday evening), the two leading candidates were Jaiden and Anthony. Turns out, neither of them ended up being the highest scoring loser. In fact, one of them ended up winning over the actual highest-scoring loser, Thomas! The Jaiden v. Thomas game was won by the slimmest of margins, at the last minute. Watch below – if you look closely, you can pinpoint the second when Thomas’s heart rips in half.</p>

<p>Ouch. A pick six with two minutes left in the Rams/Raiders game to bring the Rams D to 15 points, which edged Thomas 129-128. I gotta say, that’s heartbreaking. Even though Thomas does have the highest-scoring player (Tyreek Hill, below), he couldn’t quite get the win over Jaiden. Ah well, it’s only one week!</p>
<p><strong>Lowest-Scoring Win: </strong>Sidd’s lowest scoring win this week honestly wasn’t that low-scoring. 114.1 is a solid score, even in half-PPR. 20 point games from both of his running backs was honestly expected. Watson had an awful day and still put up 11 points, which is better than a couple other starting QBs around the league. He also got loads of points out of his D and kicker. Sidd would have beat every other loser except Thomas.</p>
<p><strong>Bottom of the Barrel:</strong></p>

<p>Hey, Sidd. Didn’t you run all of our draft teams through a program to see who performed the best? Who was number one? Was it this week’s dumpster fire of a team, owned by last year’s second place finisher, Damian Larson? It was? Wow, that’s surprising! I guess their algorithms weren’t very good. Maybe if they added IBM’s Fantasy Insights With Watson<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> it would have been more accurate.</p>
<p>But man, talk about rotten luck. The Cardinals on offense struggled to get anything going, which limited David Johnson. Christian McCaffrey fumbled on his first drive where he might have scored – an 8 point swing right there. Chris Hogan turned out to not be Brady’s number one WR target. Jimmy Graham was irrelevant. Jamaal Williams averaged like three yards a carry. And good god, that Saints D (more discussion below). There were some bright spots, though. Rivers was the third best QB on the day, with 29 points. Golden Tate had a solid outing Monday evening vs. the Jets. And Vinatieri looks to be a kicker you can trust again, now that Luck is on his side.</p>
<p><strong>Top Player: </strong></p>
<div style="width: 525px;" class="wp-video"><video class="wp-video-shortcode" id="video-47-13" width="525" height="295" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1lCEVp6AaGAmVzI9PH/giphy.mp4?_=13" /><a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/1lCEVp6AaGAmVzI9PH/giphy.mp4">https://media.giphy.com/media/1lCEVp6AaGAmVzI9PH/giphy.mp4</a></video></div>
<p>Tyreek Hill is fast. Mahomes and Hill hooked up once for a huge bomb in the preseason, which gave you an idea of just how deadly that combination could be. I think defenses are going to have a real problem with Hill this year. I was worried a little about Mahomes (as I am with all new quarterbacks). I thought he might be too raw this year, and throw a lot of picks. He still may. But Hill is certainly a proven weapon. I hope that after this game, defenses start to overprepare for Hill and forget about the other threat, Travis Kelce. Please.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Start: </strong>Hey, it is roast Damian day! Whenever you start a team defense that scores a -9, you get roasted, no matter how much everyone thought the Bucs would suck going into this game. Damian was on the wrong end of Fitzmagic this time. So what do we think of the Saints D going forward? Are they worth trying again, or are they going to give up big yardage and over five touchdowns every game going forward? It’s hard to say, but I have a general rule of not looking at defenses that post negative scores until proven otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Worst Bench: </strong>I’d say the combination of Mahomes + Kittle for Sidd this week would be the worst benching decisions. It didn’t really end up mattering for Sidd, but both of them would have been massive upgrades to the Watson and Mike Gesicki combo that he started. Ekeler would have been an upgrade over Lynch too, surprisingly, but I don’t fault him for not starting Ekeler.</p>
<p><strong>Weekly Challenge: </strong>After tallying up the numbers, the highest score for starters + bench goes to Sidd! Way to earn that $5. Honestly, it wasn’t even close – his 190.5 was a good ten points above the next best player, me. Take your damn money.</p>
